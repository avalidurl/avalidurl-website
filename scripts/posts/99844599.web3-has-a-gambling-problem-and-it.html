<p><strong>Crypto</strong>-economics, &amp; the <em>cryptographically secured</em> artistic, socio-cultural, and financial progress &amp; advancement thereof are currently under attack.</p><p>This attack is termed as <strong>web3</strong> since verbiage matters. </p><p><strong>Web3</strong> is not a word employed, and deployed, for the sake of character space optimization for Twitter stati.</p><p>…and, this short-read is not about at all what we should call evolution—whether it be crypto, or web3.</p><h2><strong>The Attackers</strong></h2><p>Attackers are unique in their sense of perception of the world we are obliged to share with them. </p><p>Majority of our OG, and native, cryptoverse dwellers are not aware that people who have tried to launch a career in the three pillars of the psyops economy have been practically starving if they are not employed either by a news media mogul, or drafted a contract with creme de la creme faux-left wing publishing houses.</p><p>For years, <strong>these people</strong>—among whom there exist countless sincere and valuable individuals, and with whom I shared a decade of blockspace at Humanities and Social Sciences departments, NGO “happenings,” <em>the</em> art world—<strong>have been desperate to secure a grant, or a funding</strong> for their artistic, or research-based projects that might or not affect the overall state of the society, culture and both human and non-human agencies that populate it.</p><p>During the short super-cycle of ready-made inflation, and all too social status seigniorage across the interwebz that faded a culmination of culture wars among the two cultures, and their myriad sub-factions; it was not the ownership of economy, or the nature of work that made the real difference by means of a evolutionary vibe inherent in their own mechanics.<br><br>People who have been critical of blockchain-based technologies due to the resentment of not being able to assert their own status via gains in the minefield of zero-sum games, who also find religiously awkward (not irrational) grifts in critiquing an evolutionary phase of humanity where time-making is now ascribed unto the heart of very networks by blockbuilding which will probably have biologically evolutionary complications and implications, too, thanks to the recent unconditionally forked advancements in the domain of large language models by merely a decelerationist grift.<br><br>They tell others that this novel mechanism of game of life boils the oceans which ebb and flow under the affect of the Moon. </p><p>Hence, they grift their own centralized network where almost no actors exist, and become of Lindy carriers only to re-bridge their insecure sense of being back to the glorious mainnet.</p><p>However, they got lucky.</p><h2>The Gullible Natives</h2><p>At one point, total market cap of all crypto assets combined reached a liquid consistency of about ~3T USD. Individuals, funds, and DAOs were literally throwing money at anyone who wrote a Mirror post, and editioned it. Social grifters used the identity politics markets to extract millions. In the meantime, import artists, academics, and curators, and at times theorists, were busy implanting the venomous grammatology of a world that reeks of vanity, laziness, resentment, and addictions unto the chain whilst at the same time accusing real builders, developers, programmers and ecosystem designers of being profit-oriented, and labelling anyone an NFT shillfluencer when they wake up at 5 pm with an extreme hangover that not only dried up their bodily systems but also that of reasoning features inherent in them as homo ludens.</p><p>When they utter the word play, they mean gamification. </p><p>They have a poisonous network of galleries, artists, curators, academics, and noones who have been busy wasting the tax-payers’ capital on their own ridicules. They infiltrated the system, the multi- and cross-chain constellations, and took every dime of their energies to shit on the only viable sandboxes such as the core of Bitcoin, any Ethereum Virtual Machine based system, and helped predatory marketing teams to create centralized faux-chains that turned the fine art markets into less-than-degen circuses.</p><p>DeFi Degens who provided the liquidity were at least open to ideas, experimentations, and supported each and every artist.</p><p>However, since their more decorated friends were getting funds behind </p><p></p><p></p>
