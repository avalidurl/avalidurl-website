<p>It was the so-called crypto-art niché that catapulted unto a state of use case maximalist in terms of smart contracts; and, for the last 7 months, Ethereum has been the proto-Uncanny Valley where I can idealistically experiment with the idea of self-sovereignity. Nope, I am not talking about financial indepence—which has come in time gradually by the clever steps that I have been taking.</p><p>I love art since, as in the words of late Sir Roger Scruton, we can redeem beauty through it, and I am totally against the promotion of half-rekt application/ software drafts that devour the Instagrammized standards of ugliness. Ugly aesthetics has always been a global marketing coordination revolution for people who are in one way or another creatives by their own standards, and I enjoy their overall resonances through both marketing as a praxis for survival, and the development of technological infrastructure (software, apps, and whatnots). I am more of a “we-are-going-to-be-immortal-and-niftiy-our-individual-entities-and-mint-ourselves-parsecs-away-one-day-thanks-to-the-advances-in-file-aka-digital-object-maintenance-and-resilience” guy, and love experimental poetics where you need to know coding. No, I do not know how to code yet.</p><p>However, there is a very subtle vacuum of full-rektiness for the unexperienced, or most of the times lazy artist out there on the very infrastructure they call blockchain. </p><div><hr></div>
