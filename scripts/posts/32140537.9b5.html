<p>I was one of those guys who didn’t dare to long the speculative coin value of the Hashmasks non-fungible. It wasn’t due to the condition that I had enough $ETH reserves, and did not buy when they were mintable at $ETH 0.1 per token. It was rather a rekt month for me considering that my only income and outcome sum consists of the parabolic yet humble Ethereum savings that I managed to accumulate since the late April 2020—when your entry is bound to a not-well-performing outsider fiat currency, regardless of your sentiment readings, research skills, and intuitive gut flux capacitor with regards to DeFi; you just end up a risk-management tailor who provide services to the Kingsmen of the scene. Yes, I am also aware there is a flock of black swans every 4 hour out there, and taking risks by paying the cost of opportunity is a full-time MA degree in its own domain.</p><p>CryptoPunks, Autoglyphs, Avastars… Rarible, SuperRare, OpenSea… Nifty Gateway, NBA Topshots… Dark Forest, Cometh, Neon District… RSI, Accumulation/ Distribution… Speculative coin demand seeking out ways to leverage that to a demand base of transactional one via myriad experimentation in terms of all types of media (currently excluding designer wetware). Quarterly hypes through the different clusters of non-fungible object ecosystems all trying to solve their specific local knowledge problems in the face of an acceleratingly evolving almost-niché of the larger Ethereum ecosystem (sorry, I just do not like custodial marketplaces, and I only use a single CEX when I need to cash out for daily life).</p>
