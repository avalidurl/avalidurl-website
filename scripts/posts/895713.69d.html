<p>I am one of those guys who transformed himself into a rather refined Chad. Yes, that one l/acc keep a distance from, and irrelevant philistinism frog-monk-cathtrads keep following. I have a healthy routine in that my guy de Grey promised us a future in which we might not die, or at least double the span.</p><p>From the Take-me-out-Tonight Doomer miserabilism of obesity days on, I took the real risks and changed my life into an honest node for especially myself. I even taught myself how to boot up an Urbit ship on a shitty laptop.</p><p>Quarantine days did never good at hometown where I was kind of taken hostage by my family for 5 months, and I headed back for my own place in Istanbul a couple of months ago.</p><p>I refined that daddy potbelly, caused an intentional calorie deficiency, and took up a habit of healthy sleep mode from 11 pm through 5 amâ€”until fortnight ago.</p>
