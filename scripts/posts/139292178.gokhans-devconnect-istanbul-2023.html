<p>I’ve been an onchain critter confined to the constraint poetics of blockspace at 69kb in sum for about a little more than a half a decade when it comes to practice as a conceptual artist, lowercase generalist researcher, frequent trader and an incorrigible proponent of genuine technological acceleration when it comes to life extension—preferably immortality, AGI, neuroscience, synthetic biology with a firm belief in modular but structured governance schemes since before tabloids such as the Guardian were witch-hunting people for their posts in the #CaveTwitter.</p><p>…&amp; it was my first conference, and hackathon ever if we do not term ZuConnect Istanbul 2023 and Hack Zuzalu thereof applicable equivalents to this line of events. </p><p>I started volunteering at ZuConnect on the 28th of October, 2023 with the orientation even though I was an unsuspecting fresh resident unaware of what beautiful an experience it would unravel to be, and was actively attending every bit of the information flow auction at the social layer for all of the above-mentioned organizations through 19th of November, 2023.</p><p>Here are my favorite rounds of hacks that in actual have practical applications which will help you better your services either you are in it for the protocol level mechanism markets design or that which is now dubbed as the consumer crypto.</p><h2>All the Cool Aliens on the Scene Design Fee Markets since It’s what Biological Evolution Dictates.</h2><p>I know I have repeated this googleplex of times but the average crypto-systems individual is too busy and they do not even remember you the next morning—I am not sure if this is due to the lack of nootropics during the nomadic phases. Yet, if they recall you the next day, you have best friends. On a day I was really tired of all the “community,” “weeb3”, “consumer crypto”, “another network state but a dApresso vending machine on a chain you have never heard of” side events, and gossip networks, I decided to attend one of my favorite and truly decentralized yet rationally structured organization’s hacker house research-a-thon aka “hookathon” at a rather comfish Cihangir top-floor duplex where drinking water was abound but people were craving for pizza—we’ll come to the pizza issue later.</p><p>Alright, I forgot to mention what I have repeated 1001 plateux times: I entered the premises half an hour late, sweating like a true bipedal Westworld drone because I forgot how steepy the Beyoğlu back-hoods are and also the weather was too volatile and I was wearing literal mountaineering equipment on 95% humidity day where the wind was just severing your guts due to the coldness it housed. I hated those types of weather all my life, and even that did not prevent me from reaching another elevator-less building on a stair street where a couple was trying to save the world:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2472d66-b055-4b2b-8a0b-9e03facdb86b_768x1024.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2472d66-b055-4b2b-8a0b-9e03facdb86b_768x1024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2472d66-b055-4b2b-8a0b-9e03facdb86b_768x1024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2472d66-b055-4b2b-8a0b-9e03facdb86b_768x1024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2472d66-b055-4b2b-8a0b-9e03facdb86b_768x1024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b2472d66-b055-4b2b-8a0b-9e03facdb86b_768x1024.jpeg" width="768" height="1024" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b2472d66-b055-4b2b-8a0b-9e03facdb86b_768x1024.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1024,&quot;width&quot;:768,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:193055,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2472d66-b055-4b2b-8a0b-9e03facdb86b_768x1024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2472d66-b055-4b2b-8a0b-9e03facdb86b_768x1024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2472d66-b055-4b2b-8a0b-9e03facdb86b_768x1024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2472d66-b055-4b2b-8a0b-9e03facdb86b_768x1024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Nay, these are not the couple but only after having spent 10 minutes among the Flashbots fullhouse would I realize Uniswap Foundation people are, too, based as fuck.</p>
