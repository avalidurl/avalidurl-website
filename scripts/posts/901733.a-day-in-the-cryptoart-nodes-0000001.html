<p>Well, digits do no matter, and practically it must be my 6th month in that which they call CryptoArt. &amp;, hell aye, I am always excited by the anti-fragile problem-solving capacities of non-fungible tokenosphere. As are some whales, I am also a use-case maximalist. A manifest destiny trotters who has been late to all, except for the crypto art scene. What strikes me as dark humor nowadays is that I am late to the DeFi scene, and I love how the play element teaches many that game of life can be played with swarm mechanics whereby individuals may exit from the fetlife dungenosphere of traditional everyday enslavement that has a life span as long as one is alive.</p><p>Remember the glitch art mafias mobbing the Facebook ecosystem a couple of years ago? They seemed to like that it would be nice to shard Peggy Guggenheim into many and make myriad John Cages cry whilst Duchamp was not giving a fuck. Aye, everyone is responsible for their own well-being. But if you state that, and also try to hashify lil12</p>
