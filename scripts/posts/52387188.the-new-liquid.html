<p>Unlike the commoners’ belief, liquidity is not a meme—nay, I am not referring to mimetic virality of a given concept in any context. Memes are stripped bare by majority of those who enjoy them, which is in fact not a bad thing whatsoever. To repeat, liquidity is not a meme—nor will the new liquid a meme. However, individual liquidity components, or to inline with the fashion they are given life with, constituents, can be memes themselves.</p><p></p>
