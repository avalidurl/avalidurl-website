I know it will take longer in that humans are lazy.</p><p>In the meantime, please do follow me at gigabvgatti—any other username that starts with 0xgokhan has nothing to do with me (apparently they’re also named Gökhan, a very pop Turkish forename that means the Ruler of the Heavens):</p><div data-component-name="Twitter2ToDOM" class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/gigabvgatti/status/1623841145007505409?s=20&amp;t=vqWJu8R-I7HQcjOWQ4r0SA&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;this is <span class=\&quot;tweet-fake-link\&quot;>@0xgokhan</span>. \n\n<span class=\&quot;tweet-fake-link\&quot;>@elonmusk</span>, are you aware that your system locks accounts who need to hop among VPN hotspots because of you know whys?&quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;gigabvgatti&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;0XGOKHAN ALT&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Fri Feb 10 00:27:53 +0000 2023&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{},&quot;retweet_count&quot;:1,&quot;like_count&quot;:1,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:{},&quot;video_url&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false}"><a class="tweet-link-top" href="https://twitter.com/gigabvgatti/status/1623841145007505409?s=20&amp;t=vqWJu8R-I7HQcjOWQ4r0SA" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-header"><img class="tweet-header-avatar" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/twitter_name/w_96/gigabvgatti.jpg" alt="Twitter avatar for @gigabvgatti"><div class="tweet-header-text"><span class="tweet-author-name">0XGOKHAN ALT </span><span class="tweet-author-handle">@gigabvgatti</span></div></div><div class="tweet-text">this is <span class="tweet-fake-link">@0xgokhan</span>.
