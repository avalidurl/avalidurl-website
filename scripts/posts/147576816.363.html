<h1>DeFi</h1><p>ðŸ’¬  <strong>MakerDAO to offboard WBTC</strong></p><p>For those of you who are not aware, you do not have direct native bitcoin coins on other networks such as infrastructurally Ethereum-aligned ones (EVMs), or Solana (SVM). In order for anyone to have access to BTC on these networks, there are infrastructures that somehow wrap bitcoin onto the desired chains. WBTC is one of these bridged assets.</p><p>Wrapped BTC (WBTC) is the 13th largest asset ($USD ~10B) in the entire crypto-currency market, and it supports the Ethereum mainnet aka L1 alongside Cosmos, Kava. It has support for 34 networks overall on the Ethereum ecosystem currently, that is, you can have re-bridged versions thereof on layer2s like Polygon, and Base.</p><p></p>
