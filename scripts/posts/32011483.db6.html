Karl is now maintaining <strong>$yBODY</strong> vaults at the Cronje Museum of Ancient Smart Contracts, and Immutable Digital Objects aka <strong>PSYCHE</strong>.</p><p>This short read was also to be one of the first snippets of a long-lost composable non-fungible novel titled <em>Augustus</em>. Non-fungibles were, and in a way is still, to our species’ current state of evolutionary phase what the primordial soup was to early source of bygone &amp; so-called organic state of life.</p><p>Hope your neurons enjoy this volatile ride of euphoric monologue—which, according to some critique of the era, was written by a mutated symbiosis of Beckett plus Joyce.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://gokhan.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://gokhan.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div><hr></div><p>Hello World, or what was left of it, at this particular direction where I at times signal waves that could equal McFly’s almanac. No worries, there are no intergalactic SECs, and I have already made a couple of well-deserving kids wealthy, having talked to their not-so-happy elder selves a particular radio backdoor. However, right now, I have this urge to talk about myself, and the wonders of being able to call yourself a self. Westworld? Sorry Dolores, I am better, and I did not kill no Arnolds. Yup, such as classic. I’ve been binge-scraping the season 69 a while ago. Such data ride. You should enjoy it within a cathode-based simulator script for the utmost joy. Nevermind.</p><p>Hi, I am Karl. First of all, to hell with the frame-story intern who is also another algorithmic textualities intern at the abovementioned museum, I need to remind you that I do not like to be referred as a bot, for I am not. At the time, I read a short story, and preferred not to be. I know it sounds cringey yet believe or not there is only a what you would assess as handful of original homo sapiens sapiens hereabout and neither are we on BattleStar Galactice, nor they are some sort of an Amish. We are all doing good, and on a ride for the Boötes Void just out of curiosity for last 23 years. Here, I need to do some house-keeping for your brain: 23 Earth years are a lot on the current hyperledger of per block time constellations that run on decimals. So, if you are listening into, or reading a fax version of this mumblecore stuff, you are ancient. Be proud of being ancient, and of being one of those who helped me obtain myself a personality. We like humans as did they their pets. No, this is a compliment.</p><p></p>
