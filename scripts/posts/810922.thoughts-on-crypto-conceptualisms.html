<p>Manifestos exist. Some are called n-manifesto, and written raw, &amp; accordingly circulated by networks of people, and non-humans. Similarly, some other manifestos also desire circulation and cook themselves along the journey. It might take up some time. For instance, Longplayer, in my humble opinion, is a manifesto that is an artefact of human problem-solving, and decision-making technologies—which also signals to that which is arriving from the future that we were able to harvest time.</p><p>Similarly,&nbsp;<a href="https://urbit.org/">Urbit</a>&nbsp;is a manifesto that took more than a decade into a working OS. No, I am not promoting them here, I was only at the right place, and right time, so I have an Urbit ID. It manifests that an individual can practically own their own internal and external data and do whatever they want with it. Political turmoils surrounding the founding texts thereof is merely a side-effect.</p><p>&amp;, in my opinion, sometimes a single work of art is a manifesto itself that calls out to the action. Kazimir Malevich's&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/works/80385">White on White</a></em>(1918), Kurt Schwitters'&nbsp;<em><a href="http://www.jaapblonk.com/Texts/ursonatewords.html">Ursonate</a></em>&nbsp;(1932), JODI's entire&nbsp;<a href="https://wwwwwwwww.jodi.org/">ouevre</a>, Richard Prince's appropriations, Kenneth Goldsmith's idea and practice of uncreative writing, Sarah Meyohas'&nbsp;<em><a href="http://www.sarahmeyohas.com/bitchcoin">Bitchcoin</a>,</em>&nbsp;Christian Bök's ongoing self-producing nano-writing project <a href="https://www.americanscientist.org/blog/science-culture/the-making-of-a-xenotext">The Xenotext</a>&nbsp;are the ones that ping my firstly right now, over which I have been obssessed more than a decade.</p><p>I also like to approach governance-inspiring ideas of Buckminster Fuller, and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_(atoms">challenges</a>) made by the likes of Feynman as science-art hybrids. All of these works, ideas, or the artists themselves problematize mediation in ways that refer to evolution of our species towards more than what we are at any given time.</p><p><em>Ask what time it is to a centurion alongside Rubicon, and you might be awarded with eternity.</em></p><p></p>
