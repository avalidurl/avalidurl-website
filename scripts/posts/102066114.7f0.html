I am trying to learn all that jazz that feels like a personal primordial soup of a future that will be bet across blockspaces. By blockspaces, I do not only mean to operate like a financial degen of all sorts. The educated bozo amongst us might not have yet understood that we have been measuring time per block time. Everything is speculated in relation to the blockspace, its storage and gas limits, its real-time re-architecturing by a metabolism movement like complexity of on- and off-chain bazaars where MEV, censorship, zero-knowledge, mempool screening, and the truffles on the dark forest ground that is yet to liquidate itself into a dark ocean splash speculative resonances of both solid and abstract matter.</p><p>Here I am sitting in this living room. I am about to go to the kitchen, and cook the second coffee of the day at around 3 PM. I just cannot stop thinking about my perception that I live in an operating system that is not compatible with any existing package manager, and for all those years, developers, programmers and others who also built the best inter-operable operating systems do not even give a fuck, and at times just express that your kind shall better not even exist. So, you talk about self-hosting your operating system (no, I ain't talkin about Urbit although I like to think about that people build such stuff in order to escape into a more robust reality in the case of a raqequit.</p><p>Enough mumblecore:</p><p>The way your constituency, and jurisdiction operate within the larger constellation of legally engineered bodies of governance, or that are pretended to be functioning so in large swathes of geographies that are neither necessarily only home to a few diasporas, should nor be called global South, in that, they can be in the vicinity of a North, is similar to how you organize your existence.</p><p>You are either bound to be suckled alive by the craze of masses who might go utterly dysfunctional where the play of irrationality does not only occupy the future philosophers as a pastime but also eats you alive in the present, or ripple through this jungle by a strictly self-enforcing plan that does not need any productivity tool other than your own discipline.</p><p>I am sitting in this room listening to deep house progressive to isolate myself from the constant distraction of masses' self-inflicted pain without being a heartless bastard at the same time.
