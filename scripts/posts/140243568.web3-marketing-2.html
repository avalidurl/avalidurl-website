They can either be from a service like LinkedIn regarding a private message, or a Substack newsletter item.</p><p><strong>Anon69, you have 5 messages waiting for you and consider adding pseudoanon69. </strong></p><ul><li><p>What are these messages? </p></li><li><p>I have received responses or some recruiter has just spammed me again on free credits? </p></li><li><p>This newsletter does really talk about the abstract tokenomics of the given product, or is it just another low taste lure that will make me click their main website?</p></li></ul><p>If you are running a newsletter and dependent on content marketing, let’s be honest: </p><p>Many people hate visiting your pop-up cemetery of a website that buries the lede at all times.</p><p>I for one have a specific Protonmail folder structure for given and myriad newsletters and content marketing leads. I follow them from within my e-mail service for which I pay about 30 USD a month on a visionary tier because they are good at what they are doing. They also let me use these folder structures as a nice RSS feedish system. You have to be really intriguing for me to leave that inbox. </p><p>Me? I am a power user of all things crypto and web3, and many returning customers of yours are so. But, I hate being forced to click a link if it is not intriguing or I feel the need to click it since your lead is misleading in its ambiguity.</p><p><code>Also, do not trade security for CtRs.</code></p><h1>Do not Force the Convention</h1><p>I do understand that there are many cases for web2 which make it utterly feasible and easy to use the platforms and protocols, let alone services running on them. That’s why limitation-pilled blockchain-enabled systems are sometimes having existential crises, and some galactic brain marketing expert, or social media rat, think that we need infantilized endusers who should not have a say in their mode of onboarding, security, and interaction with our products.</p><p>Now, let’s be brutally honest here. That is not even web2!</p><p>It is pure web1. It is 1968. You have a compute station at home waiting instructions from DARPA.</p><p>Do not be like that. Licklieder would not like it. </p><p>Be the DARPA of web3. Open frontiers for the retail.</p>
