<p>TL; DR: I am <em>neither affiliated nor do support </em>any tokenomics project other than my very own <a href="https://gigabvgatti.medium.com/ghoul-city-2069-a-novel-f3ecd483b586">NOVEL</a>.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong> </p><p>I comprehend that it is of upfront honesty that you reveal the fashion in which you yourself operate with regards to clusters and constellations in terms of <em>decentralized finance</em>.</p><p>This one will be a briefing for all of my friends, and any interested parties.</p><p>First of all, I would like to upfront state that I am <strong>neither</strong> involved <strong>nor</strong> affiliated with any #DeFi project, or proposal directly.</p><p>All of my affiliations are as far as it gets to the boundaries of the a) individual, b) personal, and c) game theoretical play. </p><p>Here is a comprehensive list of my affiliations—all of which are but me:</p><p><a href="https://linktr.ee/degen">https://linktr.ee/degen</a></p><p><strong>A Shorter History that Longs the Future</strong></p><p>So far, I have created both work of arts and memes that I have sold to various collectors in DeFi via my verified <em>Rarible</em> account, and <em>OpenSea</em> front store <em>DECIMALS</em>. It is because of the fact that:</p><ul><li><p>I am experimenting with the memenomics of the non-fungibles in terms of protocols, communities, and organizations;</p></li><li><p>as everyone else, I need to think of myself and make some “future money”—which is unironically only possible through the simplest tools at your elbow when you are not living under a first world economy. (Any non-first worlder would get what I am imply herein. Plus, I am more pro-Western capitalism than many first-worlders. It is because I have learned the hard way.)</p><ul><li><p>IE, I do <strong>not</strong> have the self-pitying subaltern mindset.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>DISCLAIMER regarding $TELAH and others</strong></p><p>So far, <em>I have not been professionally involved with any</em> protocol, brand, or tokenomics experiment. Several figures including the head of several finance protocols such as <a href="https://www.osho.finance/">OshoFi</a> etc. DM’d me about how I am paid in general, and how “$HATE, $BASED” etc. commissioned me.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Noone has so far commissioned me</strong>.</p><ul><li><p>I do what I do for <a href="https://based.fun">$BASED</a> for the game theoretical approach thereof. Their elasticity and ever-boiling experimental grounds through, for instance, rovers and the Moonbase is what allures me, and as someone who in actual penned a dissertation on the preservation of digital born narratives, I like to play with the memenomics of the community thereof.</p></li><li><p>I loved how <a href="https://www.heavensgate.finance/">Heaven’s Gate Finance</a> played with the idea of a detrimental cult that I do not approve in real life, and reflect it in their mechanism of tokenomics; and, willingly shared the news about them for both V1 and V2 respectively;</p></li><li><p><a href="https://rope.lol/">$ROPE</a> once tried to talk to me into a commission via a <em>Twitter</em> DM, &amp; they were about to invite me to a <em>Discord</em> channel—which never happened because of their “busy schedule,” and I do not like to wait at all for people for more than a month in terms of a professional offer.</p></li><li><p>Self-alleged mock-guru of $LOVE of OshoFi also wanted to talk me into a NFT deal but I stopped the conversations at a point where it did not feel satisfactory in terms of communications.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>I do not even know who $TELAH are, and despite all my efforts to sustain a transparent communicative stance, I can no longer be a part of the core community of theirs, that is:</p></li></ol><ul><li><p>After $HATE realized their Proof-of-Gate, and migrated from token V1 to token V2, I was approached by a couple of friendly anons who claim to be from the extended $BASED community. They wanted to build a community on top of $HATE V1</p></li></ul><p></p>
