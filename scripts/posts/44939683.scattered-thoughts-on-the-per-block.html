<p><em>Nay, I am not in Mirror DAO. I am just sitting at the top 5 in the $WRITE race which is currently inactive. The only info you need is that it is FREE to use for anyone as a web3 content platform with a cryptopgrahic suite of tools . Cheers.</em></p><div><hr></div><h1>DAY 1 ü•∑</h1><p>One of the hardest part of writing a piece of readable material by homo sapiens is the writing medium itself. I really have no idea why I am writing this piece on <em>my Substack</em> today‚Äîjust as <a href="https://mirror.xyz/dashboard">Mirror</a> is free for anyone to use. For those who do not understand why I compare <em>Substack</em> to <em>Mirror</em> is easy simple as it gets:</p><ul><li><p><em>Substack</em> operates on <strong>web2</strong> where I cannot claim full ownership over my written assets‚Äîwhich is mainly due to the fact that their payments intermediary <em>Stripe</em> does not cover my geographical location on the planet Earth. </p></li><li><p><em>Mirror</em> has a base constellation of communities of user from myriad backgrounds who focus on and work through a <strong><a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/web2-vs-web3/">web3</a></strong> economy of <a href="https://alexmesoudi.com/publication/mesoudi_cultural_2011/">cultural evolution</a>/ production ¬± <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/intellectual-property/">intellectual property</a>‚Äîherein, please also see Gabriel Shapiro‚Äôs ‚Äú<a href="https://lexnode.substack.com/p/fork-law-meditations-part-1">Fork Law Meditations</a>.‚Äù</p></li><li><p>It is really hard to <em>directly</em> initiate a <em>Decentralized, and Autonomous Organization</em> (DAO) [<a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/05/06/daos-dacs-das-and-more-an-incomplete-terminology-guide/">1</a>,<a href="https://linda.mirror.xyz/Vh8K4leCGEO06_qSGx-vS5lvgUqhqkCz9ut81WwCP2o">2</a>,3] on a web2 platform such as <em>Substack</em>. However, <em>Platform-protocol</em>s such as <em>Mirror</em> have all the tools that you might need for a seed round to <strong>a)</strong> fund yourself, or <strong>b)</strong> another individual, or <strong>c)</strong> a community, or <strong>d)</strong> anything that can be conceptually enveloped unto web3.</p></li><li><p>Since your readers are willing to decentralize their foci unto myriad nodes of cultural production, one of which can be your .txt only web3log on Mirror, it is much more easier for you than doing it on web2 where monetary streams find their way as wrapped in naked-fiat‚Äîsee aforementioned reality that I cannot monetize my Substack at where I am just as I cannot issue any debit card by the likes of <em>Fold</em> etc. That is, as a cultural producer in any media, I am bound to funnel my income through traditional finance sometimes but I can have the control over my portfolio a la non-custodial DeFi. At least, we have that level of <a href="https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/">Bankless</a>-ness <em>even hereabouts</em>. &amp;, here Mirror-like protocols help me in that I can directly sign-in through a <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/hot-wallets-vs-cold-wallets-whats-the-difference">hot wallet</a> such as <a href="https://metamask.io/">Metamask</a>.</p></li></ul><h1>DAY 2</h1><p>I recall how I started writing back in early Noughties. I used to copy trade Rimbaud in the most teenager staking probable thereabouts. It was kind of boring, and we were <em>still</em> under the influence of Woodstock ‚Äò99, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtZN9QMUNqU">Comet Hale-Bopp</a>‚Äîaye, even on the otherside of the Atlantic on a barren tobacco field, anon. </p><p>Back then, I used to use a pencil, and a piece of paper. Then, my father acquired a brickstone Motorola through some newspaper coupons just as did all the fathers in the neighbourhood. There, we the kids had to get used to the abecederium of a mobile phone which required repetitive strikes of brain signals unto plastic presence of the Latin. Years later, some told us that we were evolving our thumbs into the most degen extension of ours as apes.</p><p></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8ca86850-048f-477d-a9ff-a3d1cb65c564_485x800.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8ca86850-048f-477d-a9ff-a3d1cb65c564_485x800.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8ca86850-048f-477d-a9ff-a3d1cb65c564_485x800.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8ca86850-048f-477d-a9ff-a3d1cb65c564_485x800.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8ca86850-048f-477d-a9ff-a3d1cb65c564_485x800.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8ca86850-048f-477d-a9ff-a3d1cb65c564_485x800.jpeg" width="485" height="800" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8ca86850-048f-477d-a9ff-a3d1cb65c564_485x800.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:800,&quot;width&quot;:485,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Monkey Performing the Sanbaso Dance by Mori Sosen (1800) | Monkey art,  Monkey illustration, Japanese drawings&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Monkey Performing the Sanbaso Dance by Mori Sosen (1800) | Monkey art,  Monkey illustration, Japanese drawings" title="Monkey Performing the Sanbaso Dance by Mori Sosen (1800) | Monkey art,  Monkey illustration, Japanese drawings" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8ca86850-048f-477d-a9ff-a3d1cb65c564_485x800.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8ca86850-048f-477d-a9ff-a3d1cb65c564_485x800.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8ca86850-048f-477d-a9ff-a3d1cb65c564_485x800.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8ca86850-048f-477d-a9ff-a3d1cb65c564_485x800.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p><strong>to be continued.</strong></p>
