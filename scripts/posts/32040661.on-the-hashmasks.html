<p>If you are new-comer into the world of non-fungibles (NFTs), and the art of flipping rare digital objects without getting rekt, it wouldn’t be wrong to assume that you are also chasing after the next CryptoPunks, or Autoglyphs.</p><p>Smart contract based (semi, or full) generative (art, or not) collectibles have been on a parabolic ride lately after the bullish pendant following the “cryptoart” saturation. During the late summer 2020, both artistic, utility-based, or non-functional NFT scene was still a quite niché, only visible to rather a small number of creatives, collectors, and bittersweet observers who couldn’t enter the clubhouse for one reason, or another.</p><p>After Ser Cronje’s pump of Rarible and their governance token $RARI through a tweet, and Yearn’s niftified insurances/ covers’ intro onto the scene, different set of users across the larger Ethereum network started to focus on non-fungibles, which were already being leveraged by the memenomics of unique DeFi protocols such as $BASED.</p><p>Though, the #cryptoart index/ hashtag claims every two hours that the immutable art scene is brimming with drama, it is merely trans-tribal takes that usually rides the resenttiment and ad hominem soyuzes, which are kind of irrelevant to the evolution of media ecologies inherent to smart contracts. The real drama began when UniSwap degens (regardless of sex, gender, religion, creed, and clout) realized that NFT farming is a deal after what the Lyall’s Degenerator achieved via $MEME, and $ROPE’s considerably unique moves via Anons. I don’t wanna even talk about Off—Blue, and Kirby in that I think he was openly bullied even by the platforms.</p><p>Plus, $MEXP rugpull was even a bigger drama. Since then, except for finer arts oriented SuperRare (one day you will admit me, working a portfolio for thee), and what I would dub as the true on-chain and unfortunately über-custodial pop-art hub Nifty Gateway, self-acknowledged creatives have been going through an infinite Bloody Monday wrt to flips, and original sales. Hence, if you haven’t mastered degenomics skills, or more secure trading TA approaches, it might be possible you have been going through a kind of a depressive period since you were also making good $ETH as I was also selling memes up to 2 $ETH per piece.</p><p>…and, we are always after degeneracy on the non-fungibles scene as well since we want to make enough savings to 1) survive the everyday life as our own boss, 2) be able to collect technically unique pieces to a) boast as in a game (of life) play, b) be able to swap them one day for better ones, or a good deal of whatever the reserve currency will be then, c) to collect and hodl a token of beauty as we like to redeem ourselves through the beauty itself as late Sir Roger Scruton used to lull into our hearts.</p>
