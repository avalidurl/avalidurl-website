<p>A couple of days ago, I wasn‚Äôt aware of the <a href="https://www.lootproject.com/">Loot Project</a>. I was trying to flip some mints that were bombarded into the illiquid zones of my wallet.</p><p>There was a time during the last late Winter, and early Spring that people were waking up to the enchantment of non-fungibles, and as they term them on the CT ‚Äúnormies were coming.‚Äù</p><p>‚Ä¶&amp;, and people spam you with the ugliest pieces of debut NFTs. Now, I am flipping for them gas. Never been asked. Then, at late night for me, I read another alpha tweet by none other than Leshner himself:</p><div data-component-name="Twitter2ToDOM" class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/rleshner/status/1431457259297640455?s=20&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;This is a brilliant idea, and nails the spirit of composability.\n\nA successful ecosystem likely requires way more bags (maybe 100k-1M), but hopefully this serves as a meta verse proof of concept ‚öîÔ∏è &quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;rleshner&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Robert Leshner&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Sat Aug 28 03:23:00 +0000 2021&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;LOOT\n\n- randomized adventurer gear\n- no images or stats. intentionally omitted for others to interpret\n- no fee, just gas\n- 8000 bags total\n\nopensea: https://t.co/qSnRJ1FD0n\netherscan: https://t.co/bF9p0RSHX2\n\navailable via contract only. not audited. mint at your own risk https://t.co/uLukzFayUK&quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;dhof&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;dom&quot;},&quot;retweet_count&quot;:13,&quot;like_count&quot;:79,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:{},&quot;video_url&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false}"><a class="tweet-link-top" href="https://twitter.com/rleshner/status/1431457259297640455?s=20" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-header"><img class="tweet-header-avatar" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/twitter_name/w_96/rleshner.jpg" alt="Twitter avatar for @rleshner"><div class="tweet-header-text"><span class="tweet-author-name">Robert Leshner </span><span class="tweet-author-handle">@rleshner</span></div></div><div class="tweet-text">This is a brilliant idea, and nails the spirit of composability.

Loot is something different. It's something that has never been done before ever.

It's a paradigm shift in NFT space.
