Having a business model for these, well, businesses is alright. That which is prescribed as the decentralized or permissionless is rather the comparatively easy accessibility to the user-experience of a market, whether it be financial or pure idea re: a prediction market.Bitcoin lets me stick my wealth under a virtual cushion tethered to a some hardware craft.Ethereum and Solana let me tap into the tokenized money market funds and real-world asset backed yield.That is it. Noone asks me, except for permissioned products which also have a right to exist, and should better be existing, if I have 1M in my Trezor before I can ape into anything.Also, it takes under a minute for me to do cross-border payments which can be remitted under a second, and can be cashed out, especially in the developing world, via a bank again under a minute. No questions asked.It's because developing world fintech economies are much more composable with DeFi than the inter-imperial warring tribes across blockchain networks ranging from the regen puritans to shitcoins maxis.</p><p>&lt;div style="height: 100vh"&gt;&lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/ghost/signup-form@~0.2/umd/signup-form.min.js" data-background-color="#000080" data-text-color="#FFFFFF" data-button-color="#000080" data-button-text-color="#FFFFFF" data-title="Concepts by GÃ¶khan Turhan" data-description="Concepts that Feed Idea Markets" data-site="https://concepts.network/" async&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>
