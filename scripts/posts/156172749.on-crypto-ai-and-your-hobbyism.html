<p>Creative disruption rules the technological acceleration. Economically speaking, the global markets are going through any of the <a href="https://web.gavekal.com/books/the-general-theory-of-portfolio-construction/">four quadrants</a> at any time and only a few antifragile governments are good at profiting from any type of markets be them a bear or a bull. In the current day, AI and crypto-economics infrastructure are just recombinant innovative patches to the evolutionary and financial legacy.</p><p>Now, if you are thinking that either crypto, or AI, or both of them at a hybrid scale, are some revolutionary, if not evolutionary ends, when it comes to our still mediocre daily global acceleration towards an abundance of wealth, and peace; you are just fetishizing two emergent markets.</p><p>It is very rare an occasion that we encounter people who steer systems-of-systems in real time with ultimate focus to the best possible outcome for the entire planet—no, this ain’t a DEI bullshit, I prefer at least 12 technologically advanced exoplanets that I can nomad-hop constantly. Yet, here we are:</p><p>All we have is mediocre masses trying to capitalize on and seek rent through the dumb-struck money.</p><p>That is, today, if you are not working at the hybridization quarters of the traditional finance and crypto-economics infrastructure that innovate the existent economies, and their pipelines, you are just a hobbyist as long as you claim “you are working in le web3 space.”</p><p>The same goes for the AI. If you are not accelerating, you are just an ice cream seller.</p>
