<div class="pullquote"><p>Good Morning CT, especially CT, since my best non-existent friends are in CT.

According to the Bunny Talisman of Yearn, üê∞ Banteg üê∞, a Yearn periphery contract utilized to manage treasury assets was affected, causing a Gnosis Safe to be bricked where any attempts to even overwrite the safe guard was impossible due to the nature of contracts, attack and some over-looked details in the past. <br><br>However, it turns out that if you have approved any token transaction on CoWSwap prior to such an attack, you can form off-chain transactions and feed it into CoWSwap API off-chain, which eventually settles onchain. Contractual implications of this process is so promising (such as gas-free protocol-level interactions). <br><br>There is also a bug bounty contract to the hacker. <a href="https://mirror.xyz/yearn-finance-engineering.eth/pqWg0IXZI93NV50scPh0qy-nc0SmqFYTHufc2Tw85GU">LINK</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Volodya</strong> publishes a list of NFT attacks/ vulnerabilities. <a href="https://0xvolodya.hashnode.dev/nft-attacks">LINK</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Prestwich</strong> to deploy a community-led deployment of Uniswap v4 on Goerli Ethereum testnet.<a href="https://twitter.com/_prestwich/status/1669851049757401088">LINK</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Zeromorph</strong> Paper by Kohrita and Tova from Aztec Labs </p><p><a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/917.pdf">PAPER</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/Zac_Aztec/status/1669751810037542912">TWEET</a></p></li></ul><p></p><p> </p>
