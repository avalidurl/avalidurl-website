# Respect Others

Respecting others do not mean that you need to comply with their impractical, or cringe ideas at one point. The worst can be that you can share a stage during a crypto conference. However, itâ€™s a nice to realize that people whom you think were cringe was not that cringe and people whom you respected even more are even more mundane than you think yourself to be.

There is a saying that marketing kills the markets. Do not be the person who add to that dystopia.
