# Keystatic Integration Fixed! 

## Issues Resolved:
✅ **Route Conflicts**: Removed manual Keystatic routes (integration handles them automatically)
✅ **Output Mode**: Changed from 'hybrid' to 'static' for Cloudflare compatibility  
✅ **Prerender Conflicts**: Removed redundant prerender exports
✅ **Sample Content**: Added sample files to prevent empty collection warnings

## What Changed:
- Fixed `astro.config.mjs` - set `output: 'static'`
- Removed duplicate `/src/pages/keystatic/` and `/src/pages/api/keystatic/` (backed up)
- Removed prerender exports from dynamic pages
- Added sample content files for projects and essays collections

## How to Use:
1. Run: `npm run dev`
2. Visit: `http://localhost:4321/keystatic` or `http://localhost:4321/admin`
3. Edit content through the WordPress-like admin panel
4. Changes save to GitHub automatically
5. Site rebuilds and deploys automatically

## Admin Panel Features:
- 📝 **Blog Posts** - Edit your existing articles + create new ones

- 💼 **Projects** - Showcase tech projects and collaborations  
- 📚 **Essays** - Longer-form writing pieces
