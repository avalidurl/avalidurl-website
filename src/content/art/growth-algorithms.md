# When Mathematics Becomes Nature

Growth Algorithms explores the fascinating parallel between financial compound interest and organic growth patterns found in nature. By feeding exponential growth equations into L-system algorithms, the piece generates tree-like structures that mirror both financial charts and botanical forms.

## Mathematical Foundation

The artwork uses the compound interest formula A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) as the growth rule for each branch, where:

- **P (Principal)** determines branch thickness
- **r (Interest rate)** controls branching frequency  
- **t (Time)** drives the iteration depth
- **n (Compounding)** influences leaf density

## Visual Evolution

Each generation of the algorithm creates more complex branching patterns, mimicking how investments grow over time and how trees develop from simple stems into complex canopies. The green palette evokes both financial growth (green markets) and natural vegetation.

## Philosophical Implications

The piece questions the relationship between artificial financial systems and natural growth patterns, suggesting that our economic models may unconsciously mirror biological processes. The beauty emerges from the mathematical precision underlying both domains.
