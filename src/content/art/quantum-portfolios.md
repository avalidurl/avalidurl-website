# Uncertainty Principles in Finance

Quantum Portfolios transforms Harry Markowitz's Modern Portfolio Theory into an interactive quantum mechanics simulation, where financial assets behave like entangled particles floating in probability space.

## Interactive Mechanics

Users can manipulate portfolio weights by moving through the 3D space, watching as:

- **Asset correlations** manifest as particle entanglement
- **Risk/return profiles** appear as probability density clouds
- **Diversification effects** emerge through particle separation
- **Market volatility** drives quantum uncertainty behaviors

## Technical Implementation

The piece uses WebGL shaders to render thousands of particles representing different assets. Real-time financial data feeds into the physics engine, creating correlations that mirror actual market relationships while maintaining the aesthetic beauty of quantum visualization.

## Conceptual Bridge

The blue color palette evokes both the infinite depth of space and the cool rationality of mathematical finance. The interactive nature invites users to become portfolio managers in a universe where financial theory and quantum physics converge.

## Performance Notes

Best experienced on desktop with GPU acceleration. The piece responds to mouse/touch input for portfolio rebalancing and includes sound design that translates market volatility into ambient tones.
