## Scissor Labels—John Palmer[crowdfund://0x517bab7661C315C63C6465EEd1b4248e6f7FE183?features=](crowdfund://0x517bab7661C315C63C6465EEd1b4248e6f7FE183?features=)

This was back in January, 2021. It was the first crowdfund ever to fund an essay in itself with a LP pool thereof. According to the other, “[scissor labels](https://j.mirror.xyz/RUeJfZEZxr-hkuzUCakQyUuf2kOJVMPPiAWBaQFhhqc) are categorical terms that happen to be maximally divisive.” The concept is thus loosely based on Scott Alexander’s ‘scissor statement.’

This essay, and its crowdfunding period was the tipping for the emergence of writing NFTs as an asset, and cultural and digital object class on-chain—even though it wasn’t possible to mint native Mirror posts as [writing NFTs](https://dev.mirror.xyz/5gt60vKFJZ_tR1BjoJ7-Y0sNw7REebStHjzFU5x73J0), which itself is rather a very fresh feature.

## Matthew Ball’s Original Metaverse Essays—Matthew BallBall’s [book](https://www.matthewball.vc/metaversebook)’s hardcover version in its bound & print form has just landed in my library although according to Amazon it was cancelled due to the fact that shipment provider could not process it in Istanbulite customs. Maybe, alongside the rise of writing NFTs, we also need DAOs that tackle the shipment limitations by insuring and handling them, and in actual tracking. It is an arduous process to get a shipment without any time lost if you are living in almost the West but definitely not the East. Also a DAO that minimizes the visa process, bliz. Anyways, those things are a thing of the betaverse that precedes the metaverse.

However, few are aware of the cultural and digital object that is but an .html file that was rendered off an .md file:

## “The Metaverse: What It Is, Where to Find it, and Who Will Build It” is an essay that sold for 100 ETH on February 21, 2022.It is in its all entirety, and naturally, a writing NFT.

## Writing Token—Gabagool.eth[https://mirror.xyz/gabagool.eth/qk5AtdAuhcxAfPfR4eZg8hlzhFU1VsMEiuUKSV0SDQU](https://mirror.xyz/gabagool.eth/qk5AtdAuhcxAfPfR4eZg8hlzhFU1VsMEiuUKSV0SDQU)

Gabagool’s Writing Token is acting as as a connector among people from myriad backgrounds for, in and through the freshly emergent writing NFTs plane where plastic money legos metamorphose into cultural joineries which hold together in an architecture thriving upon pattern thinking a constellation of communities that should not necessarily be DAOs themselves in the beginning.

It is a vast collection of a Mirror edition of 1000/1000 on Ethereum mainnet unlike the writing NFTs on Mirror that are on Optimism. An experiment, it is. You should peak into the Library channel in Discord.

### Bonus track: ZORA #0 by ZORAA classic, and I mean it. .txt mode is hotter than Depeche Mode.
