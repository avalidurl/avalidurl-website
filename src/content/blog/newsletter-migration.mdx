As we are nearing the early access launch for [Kingpost](https://paragraph.xyz/@kingpost), I am rather active on the Farcaster protocol as the intern thereof. Being a growth leading intern is fun when your audience can vibe. Yet, now and then I miss my immediate circle, and push some updates, too.

I am migrating my Paragraph, Mirror, HackMD, Substack, and Medium blogs/ newsletters to Ghost. It's a new beginning that I've been cooking, and am calling it the CONCEPTS NETWORK.

For the time being, it's a newsletter documenting this and that. Yet, I'll be shipping under this structure.
