Then, I retrieved a couple of open source material law texts from their websites and choose a portion of their statements into a dada poem maker. I was wearing the exact clothing that I am wearing now when sweating so hard on that kitchen counter: a pistachio Nike Trail shirt, and a fuchsia Nike runner short.

I sprinted: First, I recorded that poem as a reading, too. Then, another funny conceptual take. On top of these, I created about ten different sound bites in Logic Pro. All too discordant. Sampled a couple of drum 'n bass intros from others' sample from cassettes pressed fresh.

Submitted my Superrare application in a couple of days. I really do not like recording myself for submissions. I can comfily speak in front of an auditorium of 1000s but I really do find it insufferable to ""share 30 minutes of my own"" for a product feedback, or a job, or any other thing application.

Anyways, in the first application in 2020, they responded that there were too many similar artists on Superrare. I always say the content is a real paperclip. Focus on the form. For this one, they have never. The way they TCRd the curational registry demands that you are in a network. But I am a full stack network myself and offer no visible profitability for any collector. Whenever I saw that file titled ""work"", I got itchy. It was because i really liked the process, which is a rare case. When it comes to processes that include artistic practices as their background, I am more like Dean Blunt.

Be blunt. Is it boring? Yes. Is not? Then, OK.

Just as I was about to trash that file into the black hole addy, I was chatting with my friend WM Peaster over Discord about our interview from then-following monthsâ€”first he interviewed me for JPG, then I interviewed him for my own Mirror blog. I like to talk with people by writing in a HackMD notebook.
