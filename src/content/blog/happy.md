You are unhappy because you leverage markets over your sense of being. You are unhappy because you are not as comfortably as were you only a year ago. Though beauty is not subjective, wealth is subjective, and for myself, I perceive wealth as a situation.

Markets are people. People and a complex network of federated non-human agents and objects that cannot even properly interact with each other because of humans rugging themselves of an evolutionary drive, that is, to survive despite the entropic decay.

People make fun of the side-effects of touching the grass. Believe me itâ€™s better than giving you scoliosis and asphalt-clad interiors of pesky lungs.

If you wanna terraform Mars, you should first know how to clone an actual patch of grass.
