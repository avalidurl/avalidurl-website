A hyperstructure is a crypto-protocol [that can run for free and forever, without maintenance, interruption or intermediaries](https://jacob.energy/hyperstructures.html).

Below is the libretto to this piece that is but an overture to a larger abstract installation, a multi-media album if you please. Anyone who feel the need to read, and record these lyrics above the audio layer of this work should strictly follow the guidelines.

If they remix it as a derivative by doing so, they should cite me myself as the original creator, and split their revenue at least at 5 per cent to my public addy.
