*[New collection.](https://opensea.io/collection/marketz) First drop. 1/1, that is a solitary confinement of an inmate that is but a digital art object.

**Francis Bacon:** That's a very good way of putting it. There's a further step to that: the whole questioning of what appearance is. There are standards set up as to what appearance is or should be, but there's no doubt that the ways appearance can be made are very mysterious ways, because one knows that by some accidental brushmarks suddenly appearance comes in with a vividness that no accepted way of doing it would have brought about. I'm always trying through change or accident to find a way by which appearance can be there but remade out of other shapes. 

It is because every individual knows little and, in particular, because we rarely know which of us knows best that we trust the independent and competitive efforts of many to induce the emergence of what we shall want when we see it.
