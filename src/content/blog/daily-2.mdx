It’s a beautiful day in that it’s the last day before the Winter Solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, and the days will get longer. That’s a beauteous news.

If you are feeling depressed my dear wee anon-chan, please be not satisfied merely by going outside, and touching some sort of a grass. You need a goal on both micro, and macro scales.

I’ll be hitting the gym on a 4-day streak today (*sorry, I paused here so as to push away the sci-fi scenario that took place for a momentary lapse of time*), and will try to make it to the Discord community meeting of **Juried Protocol Galleries**.

However, these do not cater for the currently catalogue building *Music NFTs canon. *Music NFTs are right now invested in the emergent business-making architecture, and culture-design—which is probably going to be a billion dollar industry soon enough than does any of us realize amongst the doomposting scrolls.

…and, no, I do not see **any streaming service from which you can broadcast Julius Eastman or John Cage to the obscurity hungry sincere degens** as Music NFTs. It’s just an experiment into platform design—which is a good thing.

Hence, today we are listening to a non-Music NFT album *Toon!* by Jonathan Scherk via Jelinek’s [Faitiche](https://faitiche.de/blog/2022) label:
