This is a test post to verify that our embed components are working correctly after implementing MDX support.

## YouTube Embed Test

Here's a random YouTube video - let's embed a classic:

<YouTubeEmbed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" />

This should render as a proper YouTube iframe embed with our custom styling.

## astro-embed Components Test

Let's try using the built-in astro-embed components:

<YouTube id="dQw4w9WgXcQ" />

## Bandcamp Embed Test

Now let's test a Bandcamp embed using our custom component:

<BandcampEmbed url="https://bandcamp.com/EmbedFrame/album=1473319671/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" />

This should render as a Bandcamp player showing the album with tracks.

## Testing Complete

If you can see both embeds rendering properly as interactive players (not just text or broken components), then our MDX integration is working correctly!

The YouTube video should be playable directly in the page, and the Bandcamp player should show album art and allow track preview.
