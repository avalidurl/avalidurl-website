This post was originally published on my current newsletter Concepts Network. As it’s getting more chaotic to reach a myriad of newsletter network islands that come in the form of Substack, X Articles, Paragraph and Mirror especially for the Farcaster protocol, Medium for the so-called crypto out-groups, and LinkedIn for the bizness side; I have decided to migrate to Ghost. I’ll keep using others, too, occassionally for the network reach.

But you can **[subscribe](https://concepts.network/on-ethereum-bitcoin-solana/)** here, and yes it will always be free.

Majority of the Lindy crypto protocols, platforms and products are neither decentralized nor permissionless. Having a public repo or a transparent ledger do not make any of them a magic technology that gave rise to Confoederatio Helvetica in the first place....and, it *is* OK. Having a business model for these, well, businesses is alright. That which is prescribed as the decentralized or permissionless is rather the comparatively easy accessibility to the user-experience of a market, whether it be financial or pure idea re: a prediction market. Bitcoin lets me stick my wealth under a virtual cushion tethered to a some hardware craft. Ethereum and Solana let me tap into the tokenized money market funds and real-world asset backed yield. That is it. Noone asks me, except for permissioned products which also have a right to exist, and should better be existing, if I have 1M in my Trezor before I can ape into anything. Also, it takes under a minute for me to do cross-border payments which can be remitted under a second, and can be cashed out, especially in the developing world, via a bank again under a minute. No questions asked. It's because developing world fintech economies are much more composable with DeFi than the inter-imperial warring tribes across blockchain networks ranging from the regen puritans to shitcoins maxis.
