A tropico-brutalist 🌴 dark forest 🌞 provides a prime example of a complex system 🦍.

The interactions among species thereof range from extreme generalists (so-called NFT degens will consume most anything breathing in their path) to extreme specialists (Vitalik’s ‘rollup orchid’ with a foot-long development repo, can only be developed by an Ape with a soulbound dedication—neither would beat entropy without the other.)

Do you know what Messiaen think of Xenakis when the former caught a glimpse of the latter as a pupil?

A timpani, or a tabla?

Imagine a tension on the pluck of a finger with a string abstraction on a Lute.

`pragma solidity >=0.G.M. <0.WAG.MI;`

`333>4’33” <—> Exit>Voice`

Only a DeFi user can be designated as a degen.

`DeFi>Web3.`

Add another 5 timpanis.

Comet Orchid. Rival Dealer by Burial?

Ryder Ripps is more NRx than is Nick Land a u/acc-ist.

Oblique Strategies would be alive on-chain. I hope Eno is about to realize all that jazz.

Nothing compares to YSL in fashion and metaversal fashion suck big time.
