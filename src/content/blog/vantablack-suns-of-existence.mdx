There is a certain magic inherent in the [hyperstitional](https://vimeo.com/146435027) qualities of a work of art. That is, a piece of a work of an art might process such a change that it might affect an individual at a surreal level of transformation.

However, ask any free jazz maestro whether they are happy with the audience’s reaction to their brew and they’ll not be able to tell a frying pan from a flying saucer.

These are the reason why I have just minted the collection Vantablack Suns of Existence on Foundation.

Enjoy them.

There are 4 pieces in the collection:
