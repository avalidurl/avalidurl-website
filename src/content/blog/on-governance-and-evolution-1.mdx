Mediated chargedness towards a politically correct egalitarianism a la so-called altruisms is a waste of resources. Techno-capital acceleration, on the other hand, is better positioned to make the means of survival available to those who need it the most.

The latter helps us escape the former’s waste ideologies in a much more benevolent manner. Musk might have tried to leverage the normalization of all; however, it is Buterin who is practicing it in reality.

If we are bound by the former, not only will we waste any resources against entropy, we will also be imprisoned on a dying planet.

Each and every planet may die. But, as de Grey points out that our species is about to catch up with the longevity escape velocity.
