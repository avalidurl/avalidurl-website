Itâ€™s been a while since I have jabbered over Substack. It is mainly because of the fact that the bloghouse tedium and ennui of written word for the screen applies itself to the fingers of the author. To break that boredom, I need to write on a beta feeling platform which is all the alpha.

Hence I have been writing over Mirror latelyâ€”as in writing writing where I just do not try to produce conceptual texts playing with the mediocre, or exciting, media. I have written on some music NFTs by in actual murmuring and mumblecoring on audio-visual arts onchain. It is still in experimentation period. Here you can find the links:

Other than that, I was interviewed by [W. M. Peaster](https://linktr.ee/wmpeaster) of [Metaversal](https://metaversal.banklesshq.com/) at Bankless, and [JPG](http://jpg.space). You may find the interview link here:

Other than that, this week I like that seed phrase poetry [generator](https://seed-poem-tool.netlify.app/), and been studying coding from ground 0 so that I can write one of those for on-chain mesosticsâ€”one day. It kind of takes time to learn to code when all you did was studying what others wrote as in comparative literature.

As per platform mumblecore, I really like what Erik wrote about Substack. It really is such a piece that anyone loquaciously gibberish preaching on web3, writing and decentralization should read aboutâ€”as per UI, I prefer Curve, iykyk.
@SubstackInc has now reached the tipping point of being the default for writers.
