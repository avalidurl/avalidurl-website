“I wonder what would befall my creations if I were a rare’n superb god,” murmured the based one to himself. It was [a rather biting cold outside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yib6V0WE0EI) that was waltzing ferociously with blizzard. Sipping a cup of cognac alongside some Swiss coffee was one of his favorite gut tunes after a shot of kefir, and a table spoonful of black cumin oil. Every day, right at 08:30 a.m.

He has lately been thinking about *The year 2020*, and how he used to party all night with [GHOULS](https://based.fun/), and faceless frens who were genuine, and warmblooded. 

*The year 2020* is a game title by the late Nintendo who surprisingly chose to commission the net art duo [JODI](https://joid.org/archive/) for an abstract reality RPG where players need a brand new VR headset to connect to the Hypnospace.

It was rather a semi-closed systems thinking game theoretical financial simulator that implicates the idea that y2k won’t do any bad to the global economy, and individuals will be able to self-govern at an accelerated pace of innovation via mainly recombitant capital.

He came to buy the game via an advertorial spot on the SugarCube, Mentally show Art Finally.
