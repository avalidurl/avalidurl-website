What a week. Although almost every market participant's and makers' foci shifted away from the tedium and ennui of the recession through which cryptomarkets has been painstakingly evolving, it would be of the best interest for the reader to focus on the innovations and news at the protocol level.

We are all aware that SEC vs. Coinbase is literally meta-abstracting into an information exchange directly via Twitter whilst BinanceUS attorney are upset about the allegedly ambiguous stance and language by SEC at court.

Multiply those with Fed Chair Powell's testimony before the House Financial Services Committee where he is said to have uttered that they think the crypto is here to stay whilst don't perceive stablecoins as money.

A long, nice, and arduous Summer + Autumn Le Mans awaits us all.
