Creative disruption rules the technological acceleration. Economically speaking, the global markets are going through any of the [four quadrants](https://web.gavekal.com/books/the-general-theory-of-portfolio-construction/) at any time and only a few antifragile governments are good at profiting from any type of markets be them a bear or a bull. In the current day, AI and crypto-economics infrastructure are just recombinant innovative patches to the evolutionary and financial legacy.

Now, if you are thinking that either crypto, or AI, or both of them at a hybrid scale, are some revolutionary, if not evolutionary ends, when it comes to our still mediocre daily global acceleration towards an abundance of wealth, and peace; you are just fetishizing two emergent markets.

It is very rare an occasion that we encounter people who steer systems-of-systems in real time with ultimate focus to the best possible outcome for the entire planet—no, this ain't a DEI bullshit, I prefer at least 12 technologically advanced exoplanets that I can nomad-hop constantly. Yet, here we are:

All we have is mediocre masses trying to capitalize on and seek rent through the dumb-struck money.

That is, today, if you are not working at the hybridization quarters of the traditional finance and crypto-economics infrastructure that innovate the existent economies, and their pipelines, you are just a hobbyist as long as you claim "you are working in le web3 space."

The same goes for the AI. If you are not accelerating, you are just an ice cream seller.
