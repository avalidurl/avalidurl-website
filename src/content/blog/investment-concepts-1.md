I am suspicious af of projects claiming to be "giving it back to the users." They usually are funded by VCs who really have zero clue to the underlying infra, and the phase of innovation in a given field. Do not spend fortunes on a thing that can be a simple addon in 3 months.

Privacy enterprise grade anarcho app chains with otherwise robust SDKs need to hire scouts who understand financial markets. In fact, two of them fringes: 1. A literal [[quant]]. 2. An autodidact [[DeFi]] x [[CeFi]] nerd who's not limited by efficiency as in a quant Otherwise, we'll have more projects that will be shredded into nothing, and a disposable browser plugin keychain always.

Only club-level in-groups need a separate browser addon of a chain with more than 6 steps to move money privately. If you are building for that niché, it's good. If you are aiming for the general public, or even the general market nerd, you just need to wrap it in with a runtime environment that is chain-agnostic but can run on the most popular rails that easily compose at any time. That's what institutional tokenization experimenters, banks like JPM, rails like SWIFT, card networks like Visa do with the likes of Chainlink, Ethereum, Stellar, Solana, Ethena Labs and on their own permissioned networks. They might try one of those BTC core extension of layers, soon, too, depending on the trade finance.

It is funny how we really do not have a proper motorsports sabermetrics initiative in the expanded crypto-economics x AI circles. AWS for motorsports offer highly experimental plays for the well-incentivized devs who are into real data-driven competitive progress and innovation narratives.

Indeed, I'd prefer a custodial service with Skorskies raking fear above concrete neobank sites protecting my DEPOSIT Bitcoin to wrapped and staked "onchain" wrappers that might go off any moment because of a dependency issue in a repo. Tokenized assets with "real" reserves will replace all of these crypto derivative markets synths soon. I usually end up using very badly scaffolded synth trackers that pass as RWAs when it comes to trading. Anyone who can balance via zk-KYC tiers with practically fast and cheap bank/ CEX off-ramps will earn the "anon" and "degen" perps market in that very specific RWA class. The average user now understands basic markets. They care about nuances. Have you ever checked the Benzinga UI?!

Some gigaminds here like the "wisdom of crowds" since the decentralized prediction markets are the closest they can enjoy the global financial markets.

Not an investment advice but concept.
