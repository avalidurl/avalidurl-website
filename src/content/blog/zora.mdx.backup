When I am working in ideas, I tend to want to share my drafts directly with the public, that is, friends. Since rollups make it cheaper to mint each and every idea you have either in audio-visual imagineering, or boring conceptual art pieces, or even diagrams; I tend to mint anything that I myself likeâ€”just for the provenance.
