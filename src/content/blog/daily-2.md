It’s a beautiful day in that it’s the last day before the Winter Solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, and the days will get longer. That’s a beauteous news.

If you are feeling depressed my dear wee anon-chan, please be not satisfied merely by going outside, and touching some sort of a grass. You need a goal on both micro, and macro scales.

## elite curation of information

I’ll be hitting the gym on a 4-day streak today (*sorry, I paused here so as to push away the sci-fi scenario that took place for a momentary lapse of time*), and will try to make it to the Discord community meeting of **Juried Protocol Galleries**.

**JPG** is an onchain cultural artefact exhibition ecosystem who have just announced their inventive approach to non-fungible token (NFT) indices by the might of their **Canons**:

Yes, there are experiment such as Billy Bultheel’s *[Songs for the Contract](https://www.folia.app/works/10), *or any sound-focusing artwork by [Deafbeef](https://www.deafbeef.com/), or Giga Bvgatti’s Weeb3 sounbites (aye, self shill), and many other pure contract based anomalies by shy artists who call themselves devs due to peer pressure whilst nobodies are printing stables even when they are neither artists nor devs yet are skillful enough to abuse both the gullible artworld and devtopia.

However, these do not cater for the currently catalogue building *Music NFTs canon. *Music NFTs are right now invested in the emergent business-making architecture, and culture-design—which is probably going to be a billion dollar industry soon enough than does any of us realize amongst the doomposting scrolls.

…and, no, I do not see **any streaming service from which you can broadcast Julius Eastman or John Cage to the obscurity hungry sincere degens** as Music NFTs. It’s just an experiment into platform design—which is a good thing.
