###### 4'33" (for Adventurers)

***note:** i wasn‚Äôt aware of the existence of The Herald (for Loot) Substack till the halvening of my own draft. What I do below is very similar to their Week 1 post.*

In essence, Spencer Noon‚Äôs below tweet brews all there is to be said on that which is the Loot Project by a co-founder of Vine, and dev of Blitmap among other projects:
Spencer Noon üïõ @spencernoonLoot created a new category:

Mass Multiplayer Online Metaverse Making

MMOMM for short

, and beyond are calling these times as *post-LOOT* era. Those who do not own an OG Loot Bag, and some with either biases/ lack of knowledge against/ in the base layer of technological accelerator, namely Ethereum keep critiquing the Loot Project by all means possible.

.

Anyway, I try to point out to some important *Twitter* threads, and *Substack* posts. I am aware there are many an insight on the situation, and was also writing another piece on LOOT, I lost the track. If there are any worthwhile resources out there in any media, please do comment below so that I can update the post.

I own a single OG LOOT BAG. That would be #2907. &, it all started with me whilst browsing my preferred notifications on Twitter late at night with a Leshner take:
Robert Leshner @rleshnerThis is a brilliant idea, and nails the spirit of composability.

A successful ecosystem likely requires way more bags (maybe 100k-1M), but hopefully this serves as a meta verse proof of concept ‚öîÔ∏è dom @dhofLOOT

- no images or stats. intentionally omitted for others to interpret

Loot is something different. It's something that has never been done before ever.

It's a paradigm shift in NFT space.
