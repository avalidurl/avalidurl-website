**3.**One day, I received an ERC721 token that was but a Mirror edition on Ethereum Mainnet: $ESSAI: Gabagool.eth‚Äôs Writing Token. WT. I have known him through our interaction on Twitter timelines mostly, and we DM‚Äôd each other at times talking about conceptual art, and the emergent art practices on-chain. It was a token of appreciation of my friendship and so-called ‚Äúinspiration‚Äù regarding writing non-fungibles. A gift. I wanted to return the favor, and minted another one. There, all of a sudden, I realized that it was a good opportunity to put my productivity in an experimental community-making. According to Gabagool.eth, there was a no need for any community, or a Discord server; however, the (then-non-existent) community should decide on their own future. I took the initiative myself, and created a token-gated Discord server. I was feeling productive, had the time, and wanted to master the art of üÖ±ommunity. It was because of the fact that I have been freelancing as an artist, curator, and DeFi Degen for almost three years, and I wanted to go further, and gain some experience in myriad fa√ßades of ‚Äúproduct‚Äù management.
