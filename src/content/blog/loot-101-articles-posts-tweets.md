***note:** i wasn’t aware of the existence of The Herald (for Loot) Substack till the halvening of my own draft. What I do below is very similar to their Week 1 post.*

In essence, Spencer Noon’s below tweet brews all there is to be said on that which is the Loot Project by a co-founder of Vine, and dev of Blitmap among other projects:

Mass Multiplayer Online Metaverse Making

MMOMM for short[6:10 PM ∙ Sep 4, 2021144Likes19Retweets](https://twitter.com/spencernoon/status/1434217272546054147?s=20)
A non-human Zen master might posit one day that Mass Multi-player Online Metaverse Making was the coordinapion that was needed for our species to meet the requirements of longevity escape velocity.

## 0x: Lil’Intro

I am aware that there is proliferation of content on everything *Loot Project* by any media available nowadays. It is also kind of absurd and ironic to time-stamp such a statement with an adverb such as *nowadays*. 

As of today, Loot Project is only 8 days old, and notable figures within the Crypto-Twitter (CT), and beyond are calling these times as *post-LOOT* era. Those who do not own an OG Loot Bag, and some with either biases/ lack of knowledge against/ in the base layer of technological accelerator, namely Ethereum keep critiquing the Loot Project by all means possible. 

All I can state here as a non-coder-yet-nerd-researcher (with that background in academy, that is, a Comparative Literature MA) is that LOOT has opened the gates towards the [Westworld](https://www.hbo.com/westworld) of smart contracts—nay, Dr. Robert Ford is indeed a humanitarian, and [Nick Land](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAXET4YyDUo) has no say in this in that he is a stubborn [Bitcoiner](https://etscrivner.github.io/cryptocurrent/).

Anyway, I try to point out to some important *Twitter* threads, and *Substack* posts. I am aware there are many an insight on the situation, and was also writing another piece on LOOT, I lost the track. If there are any worthwhile resources out there in any media, please do comment below so that I can update the post.

[Website](https://www.lootproject.com/)—where you can also reach approved [LOOT derivatives](https://www.lootproject.com/resources) (aye, LOOT is a sandbox modulation engine on which you can fork sandboxes of sandboxes) & many an intriguing [tools](https://www.lootproject.com/resources) that feedback or modulate your OG Loot Bag(so).

**Substack:** [Herald](https://lootproject.substack.com/p/week1?r=850ud&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=copy)—Seems they’ve already done what I’ve been trying to do in my drafts in Bear and Roam Research.

**Forum**: [Loot Talk](https://loot-talk.com/)—better than having to excavate the depths of Loot Discord Server for proposals and developments.

## 2 ) Tweets that Mattereth

I own a single OG LOOT BAG. That would be #2907. &, it all started with me whilst browsing my preferred notifications on Twitter late at night with a Leshner take:
![Twitter avatar for @rleshner](https://substackcdn.com/image/twitter_name/w_96/rleshner.jpg)Robert Leshner @rleshnerThis is a brilliant idea, and nails the spirit of composability.

A successful ecosystem likely requires way more bags (maybe 100k-1M), but hopefully this serves as a meta verse proof of concept ⚔️ ![Twitter avatar for @dhof](https://substackcdn.com/image/twitter_name/w_40/dhof.jpg)dom @dhofLOOT

- no images or stats. intentionally omitted for others to interpret
- no fee, just gas
- 8000 bags total

That was the moment I headed for OpenSea and grabbed my bag at 0.08 ETH. I have always liked anything that incorporates tech, textuality and a ludology of its own; and, as someone who is Udemy’ing the Solidity, the below tweet intrigued me even more:

What sets LOOT apart is that there are smart-contract readable parameters for each of the inventory slots, so that games and experiences can be built on top.

Imagine logging into World of Warcraft with your LOOT—which is different from everyone else’s.[3:13 AM ∙ Aug 30, 202172Likes11Retweets](https://twitter.com/rleshner/status/1432179558590164992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1432179558590164992%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Froamresearch.com%2F%2Fapp%2F0xgokhan_trial)
So, I decided to hodl. I am still hodling my bag—It took me countless worst flips and sales regarding each type of asset on-chain; from my own creations to shitcoins to gems a la NFTs. So, henlö diamond hand. Below tweet is also a LOOT 101 thread with which I am closing this post since Substack will 404 on further elongation thereof. Please visit the above-linked forum on the future of Loot, Synth Loot (I prefer it to mLoot) and AGLD.

Loot is something different. It's something that has never been done before ever.

It's a paradigm shift in NFT space.
