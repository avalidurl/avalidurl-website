Like it or not, crypto-economics infrastructure is a long-termist feature embedding itself into the grand scheme of practical macro-economics. You might dislike praxes such as HFT. However, exactly these exercises, do give direct incentives in the overall compute's steering devices such as photonics, data storage and retrieval. In this context, a single canonical client might do much more for a truly decentralized consensus than an alleged vibe-coded offshoot of a network like a layer 7.

The average mechanism designer thinks that the HFT world revolves around a Lewis book. However, transparent insiders do share even more with the world than pop culture finance books receive royalties from Hollywood remakes.

It's good that we now have more than a smol cohort of people who can operate both in the legacy (TradFi) and emergent (DeFi) worlds **beyond the software**. The road to effective compute that will make better worlds is more than application-specific integrated circuits. Some people actually are working on physical infrastructure, or marketual networks that are in fact mechanism markets' granular expressivity.

The world wants both the distributed compute clusters, decentralized consensus—credibility, security—and the lighter-than-speed (scalability) at the same time.

That is what *A Pattern Language* is for actually.

Not an investment advice but concept.
