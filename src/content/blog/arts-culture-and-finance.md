I am trying out another newsletter service that I'll be integrating into my upcoming personal memex and wrote this post there initially. I'll keep the Substack for its vendor-locked distribution network effects—they're just doing what they hate Elon is doing over the X yet here we are. This post is published also as an X article [here](https://x.com/0xgokhan/status/1911901400721694844).

There was a Venkatesh Rao post *[elaborating](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2024/10/10/ribbonfarm-is-retiring/?utm_source=gokhan.beehiiv.com&_bhlid=7fcce2702cc9ca8d86148b64fe2a672a4cec0425)* on the death of blogging—or rather the blogosphere—as we have known it up until this plateux of technological cross-pollination of idea market infrastructure. I believe it's merely a user-experience design issue given majority of newsletter and blogging platforms did want to vendor-lock us all into their own runway. I am happy with the current X's Articles section as a primary blog with variations over LinkedIn and a full backup in my Notion and Obsidian but I also want to sense that not-that-much connected reminiscence of late 2000s blogosphere.

Timelines are brimming with news covering stablecoins mania, and it's not merely a bubble in my humble opinion. Stablecoins are here to stay, and help the crypto-economics markets transcend the synthetic and nominal markets into real world backed proof-of-reserve liquidity versions.

It's understandable that the purist and the idealist whine over the idea that "normies" and "trads" come in adopt their technology yet I'd rather live in a high-trust society backed economy in the first world with actual accountability rather than in ramshackle network state AirBnB state of markets in the South-East Asia maintained by universal basic income tracking public goods funding circus that have no sense of basic home economics that rug a thousand protocols at once.

I have re-watched The Social Network again after almost a decade and recalled how well-framed a narrative that the movie offers. Slowly watching Rogan pod with Mark Zuckerberg, I still do think that it's a misfortune the global markets don't have access to a tech like Libra stablecoin.
