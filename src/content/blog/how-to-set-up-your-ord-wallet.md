# Briefing

`YES, YOU NEED TO RUN A FULL NODE TO INSCRIBE INSCRIPTIONS YOURSELF, ANON.` 

## 0. Readme.kekmd.

**Do not read and directly FOMOskip into [the third chapter](https://gokhan.substack.com/i/101022954/how-to-easily-set-up-an-ord-wallet-compatible-sparrow-wallet) if you wanna self-rug anon.**

This is a simpleton’s guide on how to set up an `ord` compatible *Bitcoin* wallet with *[Sparrow Wallet](https://gist.github.com/windsok/5b53a1ced6ef3eddbde260337de28980)* as referenced in the *[Ordinal Theory Handbook](https://docs.ordinals.com/).* 

**I am that simpleton.**

It is exclusively aimed at those who try to understand what *[Ordinals](https://discord.gg/ordinals)* and the *inscriptions* are, or anxious that they’ll not get a piece of *[Taproot Wizards](https://discord.gg/taprootwizards)* just because they do not have an `ord` wallet, or a wallet that is compatible with the `ord` wallet.

**I am publishing this simple guide that might contain errors, or be obsolete in the unconditionally accelerating phase of ever-emergent blockspace wars. It is up to you to write your own guide, or just DM me somewhere so that I can update it.**

I myself wanted to experiment with *Ordinals* in that they provide that raw block-based almost-only-text-mode artistic engineering canvas—which is why I am writing this, a self-note, if you prefer.

## 1. Be Wary of Self-Keks

[These inscribed sats can then be transferred using bitcoin transactions, sent to bitcoin addresses, and held in bitcoin UTXOs. These transactions, addresses, and UTXOs are normal bitcoin transactions, addresses, and UTXOS in all respects, with the exception that in order to send individual sats, transactions must control the order and value of inputs and outputs according to ordinal theory.](https://docs.ordinals.com/inscriptions.html)

### ☣️ **Before you proceed into this arduous journey of reading more than 333 words, I need to accentuate that:**

🦍 *Ordinals* do **not** function in the way of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to which you are accustomed across the multi- and cross-chain constellations of rektistan. [They have their own ](https://docs.ordinals.com/inscriptions.html)`inscriptions` which helps you inscribe, or write into, `satoshis` any arbitrary content.

🦍  Here, you are dealing with the way `UTXO`s work, that is `first-in-first-out`, ***not ***`the usual way`* individual **NFTs, or a collection acts or is acted upon in the usual EVM settings** thereof*.

🦍  You might inadvertently, and without any technical or security-related effort, rug yourself of that beauteous digital and cultural object of craftsmanship, that is, an ordinal just by using the UTXO that is more or less the ordinal that you hold.

### ☣️  **As is clearly stated in the *****Handbook*****:**

🐸 “Ordinals is a numbering scheme that allows tracking and transferring of individual satoshis.”

🐸 ”Satoshis are numbered in the order in which they're mined, and transferred from transaction inputs to transaction outputs first-in-first-out. Both the numbering scheme and the transfer scheme rely on *order*, the numbering scheme on the *order* in which satoshis are mined, and the transfer scheme on the *order* of transaction inputs and outputs. Thus the name, *ordinals.”*

🐸 You can attach assets such as NFTs, securities, accounts, stablecoins to ordinals. That is, **Ordinals themselves are not NFTs.**

### ☣️  After you have created a wallet for your ordinals, you need to memorize the facts that:

😎 If you have used the vanilla `ord` option to create wallet, you need to re-read the details as to how to hold, protect, or exchange your ordinals in the `ord`[ Github documentation page](https://github.com/casey/ord).

😎 Instead of using the above-listed method, I assume that you have used the *Sparrow Wallet* integration, you’ll need to re-read all the details in [receiving inscriptions and ordinals with Sparrow wallet](https://gist.github.com/windsok/5b53a1ced6ef3eddbde260337de28980).

😎 As [windsok](https://twitter.com/windsok) warns in the above-linked guide:

**“[As a general rule if you take this approach, you should use this wallet with the Sparrow software as a receive-only wallet. Do not spend any satoshis from this wallet unless you are sure you know what you are doing. You could very easily inadvertently lose access to your ordinals and inscriptions if you don't heed this warning.](https://gist.github.com/windsok/5b53a1ced6ef3eddbde260337de28980)”**

**THAT IS, you would not want to spend your unspent satoshi that is inscribed with that precious content you boast to hold.**

# 2. How to play with Ordinals?

You want to collect *Taproot Wizards* that have made the news recently thanks to largest *Bitcoin* block ever mined?

*[3:58 PM ∙ Feb 2, 20231,142Likes253Retweets](https://twitter.com/udiWertheimer/status/1621176136142045191)I wanna do more things with them, which might also help me learn some Bitcoin* technicals and fundamentals since I am only class of 2019, and have never traded, or taken interest in *BTC*.

In my humble opinion, we’re currently in an abstracted war of fog where different factions try to be the first mover on this opportunity for a cultural evolution that Bitcoin network certainly needs if they do not want to face the fate of the Neanderthals.

Well, when I woke up this morning, GM’d the CT, shilled some of my not that obscure individual conceptual art pieces, I happen to read a tweet by Udi for a Taproot Wizard giveaway, or sth sth. I realized that I wanted to set up and ord wallet about 3 am, and got pissed at off the technicals even though i like them technicals, the best puzzle game there ever better than any *Zachtronics*.

Then, I realized, as I was re-reading the *Handbook*, trying to differentiate between ordinal theory, and the inscriptions, I came across this *Github* repo readme know-how by windsok in the Handbook. It is simple, and I am doing it as I am writing about it here.

**Get in winner, we’re going retro-futur-of-Frankreich.**

# 3. How to Easily set-up an ord wallet compatible Sparrow Wallet?

`The below directions has been referenced from windsok’s original document that is referenced both above and below. If you are a visual learner, there is more in that original repo. Please do follow the steps there initially.`

We click this safe link that is referenced in the *Ordinal Theory Handbook* where we are welcomed by a readme document that reads “[receiving inscriptions and ordinals with sparrow wallet.md](https://gist.github.com/windsok/5b53a1ced6ef3eddbde260337de28980)”.

**As is clearly stated in this guide, we read the entire piece without moving a finger.**

[We download the Sparrow Wallet here](https://sparrowwallet.com/download/).

“Select `File -> New Wallet` and create a new wallet called `ord`.”

“Change the `Script Type` to `Taproot (P2TR)` & select the `New or Imported Software Wallet` option.”

“Select `Use 12 Words` and then click the `Generate New Button`. Leave the passphrase blank.”

“A new 12 word BIP39 seed phrase will be generated for you. Write this down somewhere safe as this is your backup to get access to your wallet. NEVER share or show this seed phrase to anyone else. Once you have written down the seed phrase click `Confirm Backup`.”

“Re-enter the seed phrase which you wrote down, and then click `Create Keystore`.”

“Click `Import Keystore`.”

“Click `Apply`. Add a password for the wallet if you want to.”

**FINALE:**

🌞 “You now have a wallet which is compatible with `ord`, and can be imported into `ord` using the BIP39 Seed Phrase.” 

🌞 “To receive ordinals or inscriptions, click on the `Receive` tab and copy a new address.”

🌞 “**Each time you want to receive you should use a brand new address, and not re-use existing addresses.”**

🌞 “`You can add a label to each address, so you can keep track of what it was used for.”`

### 4. Addenda

I will be updating this addenda section of this given post in line with the most asked questions across any social media, and updates by developers, and individual project teams, or leaders.

Some of you might have noticed that [windsok](https://twitter.com/windsok) added *a section* in the [original Github document](https://gist.github.com/windsok/5b53a1ced6ef3eddbde260337de28980) *on [how to validate and/ or view received inscriptions](https://gist.github.com/windsok/5b53a1ced6ef3eddbde260337de28980#validating--viewing-received-inscriptions)* that are but transactions—windsok’s document features screenshots of the entire process itself, it’s better to refer to that page per se:

“Once you have received an inscription you will see a new transaction in the `Transactions` tab of Sparrow, as well as a new UTXO in the `UTXOs` tab.”

“Initially this transaction may have an "Unconfirmed" status, and you will need to wait for it to be mined into a bitcoin block before it is fully received.”

“To track the status of your transaction you can right click on it, select `Copy Transaction ID` and then paste that transaction id into [mempool.space](http://mempool.space/)”

“Each of your inscriptions is stored in an Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) which can be viewed in the `UTXOs` tab.”

“Each of your inscriptions is stored in an Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) which can be viewed in the `UTXOs` tab.”

“Once the transaction has confirmed, you can validate and view your inscription by heading over to the `UTXOs` tab, finding the UTXO you want to check, right clicking on the `Output` and selecting `Copy Transaction Output`. This transaction output id can then be pasted into the [ordinals.com](https://ordinals.com/) search.”
