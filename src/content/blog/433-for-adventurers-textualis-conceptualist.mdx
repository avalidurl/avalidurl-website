###### 4'33" (for Adventurers), personal mint, 1/1, 6900 x 6900 px.

<NFTCard contractAddress="0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405" tokenId="80548" marketplace="foundation" />

###### synth .txt, personal mint, 1/1, .mp4.

<NFTCard contractAddress="0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405" tokenId="80553" marketplace="foundation" />

###### .txt, personal mint, 1/1, .txt.
