### Wut Wen[https://twitter.com/0xgokhan/status/1558262196253097986?s=20&t=5J3haqhfqqrjcyu-V8uibQ](https://twitter.com/0xgokhan/status/1558262196253097986?s=20&t=5J3haqhfqqrjcyu-V8uibQ)

Culturally evolutionary oriented speculative intelligentsia markets will never cease to exist, and that is a good thing. As per writing and NFTs, the only thing that I think is lacking on-chain is the possibility of composing a web3 native .epub (or any other similar format) that can be both/either tethered unto another product and/or exported unto the chain as a rich media product.

The possibilities are endless in that one of the most promising aspects of NFTs in general has always been composability. Any threat to cultural composability should also be thought well such as easy retrieval of on-chain data.

As quoted below, Harsanyi makes a case in terms of data preservation, and some degens who didn’t hear about NFTs as a tech till Cronje thought of integrating them into DeFi, and some core devs who let others question their actions a lot raises questions about the legitimacy of some upcoming upgrades, IMHO.

## ParagraphAs I have written [the first week](https://mirror.xyz/gokhan.eth/VQyjhqWtm_3YlFLPQJ1ZZItBKVwhjdodnMMQ92OC58w), Gnosis Guild have announced Tabula which can be a shared content flow for DAOs, or a book that owns a DAO per se? Who knoweth? Possibilities endless.

This week, I have come to realize that we have a new player in the known galaxy of hyperstructural joineries (Media Legos). It is called Paragraph, and I like that it is called paragraph.

[Colin Armstrong](https://twitter.com/colinarms) is building the paragraph, and paragraph (x69 more times, paragraph) is practical for the following reasons:

Markdown support,

RSS feed,

A feature titled Communities where you can directly token-gate your content, or publication, and for which I have been trying to find a solution. anticommune and Writing Token Discord members recall. Yes, there exist this and that solutions to that end, however, I want a Swiss Knife, which is Mirror and I assume it is on their menu to add such stuff—and, if I were running Mirror, I’d just co-work with Channel to experiment on the web3 media/ content streams as tweakable as it could get. Possibly a hardworking dev is reading this, and hating my guts.

In this regard, Paragraph looks like a Leatherman multi-tool, and I love my Victorinox and Leatherman at the same time for several different reasons.

Yes, writing NFTs require the skills of an on-chain bushcrafter. Sorry, I do not make the rules.

## Guild UpgradeI like Guild. I use it to coordinate at least 5 Discords. They are good, and professional as far as I am concerned the way they resolve the tickets in Discord. Plus, they are practical. This week, they shipped an upgrade among many that directly relates to writing IMHO: Token-gated Google Docs.

Alright, neither do I myself like those Google Docs—especially when they are shared across questionnaires, and the like, across web3 newsletters, protocols, platforms and the like. However, there are several practicalities inherent thereabouts, and people use them. I also use them since it’s easier to import snapshot .svgs onto Google Spreahsheets for a normie such as myself.

Token-gating docs have multiple-façade implications for any non-fungible ecosystems that run on content, writing, and collaboration. Few are aware but there are native DEXes working on Google Docs.

There should be a lab group ideating on and through platformless membership feat. writing NFTs, IMHO:
