@sassal0x @lawmaster Centralized setups can handle very high gas limit, e.g. GoChain has been running with a 136.5m gas limit and 5s block time (27m gas/s) with 21 nodes. BSC uses the same number of nodes but 3s block time (10m gas/s). Ethereum runs at 12.5m gas limit and 13s time (1m gas/s).","username":"bantg","name":"banteg","date":"Wed Feb 10 13:29:33 +0000 2021","photos":[],"quoted_tweet":{},"retweet_count":1,"like_count":32,"expanded_url":{},"video_url":null,"belowTheFold":true}">[banteg @bantg@sassal0x @lawmaster Centralized setups can handle very high gas limit, e.g. GoChain has been running with a 136.5m gas limit and 5s block time (27m gas/s) with 21 nodes.
