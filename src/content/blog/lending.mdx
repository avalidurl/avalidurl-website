This is not an investment advice. It's just a personal note on an emergent DeFi pritimitive. I am not affliated with anyone. I hold less than 50 USD worth of $YES.

Unbounded, unruggable. 

These adjectives might sound bold and blunt. Yet, I get what a promising primitive a recombinant invention might offer.

/baseline markets are a decentralized liquidity engine based lending markets. They differ from existing services thanks to several features.

As i was reading the docs, & seeing clueless people labelling the currently-only available token on the protocol as another shitcoin, i felt the need for a simple intro unto the protocol.

## Intro

/baseline is basically a liquidity engine that comes with cargo pants, and the pockets are basically deep. it's a novel DeFi protocol that builds on our shared legacy.

What it achieves can be easily overlooked since we are all used to primitives and structureds across DeFi. 

Every 13 seconds i come across another promising project. i am a walking wiki of protocolized speculative marketsâ€”whether they work or not.

Simply, what Baseline Markets achieve are:

Infinite liquidity for ERC20s with a baseline value (BLV)

A lending market that this BLV unwinds

A self-sufficient liquidity bootstrapping architecture that is human-resistant.
