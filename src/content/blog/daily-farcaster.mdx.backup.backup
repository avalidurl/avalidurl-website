](https://nounsfarcaster.com/)## RoundsRounds is a novel client that utilizes the social layer on the Farcaster protocol for channels-based competitive governance experiments on a loosely-coupled approach. 

The idea is basically that you can have a community channel around water where people cast any sort of content regarding water ranging from intellectually satisying memes to mechanism design ideas. Others can react to these casts, which function as a funding round if the given channel community is running a campaign on Rounds.

When signed in, your home view will surface your live submissions first so that you can quickly check your rewards ðŸ’° https://i.imgur.com/Sq0DvFm.gifCurrently, there are several rounds on Rounds for channels-based communities including /nouns, /higher, /nouns-animators, /members-only, and /yellow. For instance, I created the below meme for the Higher culture, and will be awarded their native token pro rata in line with the rounds condition. People are paid in ether in some other channels such /nouns for their contribution.

Basically, if you are running a community that nurtures itself through Farcaster channels, you will soon be in need of a Rounds round as a meta-governance praxis regardless of your previous governance configurations.
