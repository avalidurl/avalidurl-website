Alright, I strongly believe and foresee that, in some near future, we will be able to purchase our longevity related accessories, and conference tickets (at least) in the form of non-fungible tokens. I also believe that we will be time-travelling using body vaults parsecs away, letâ€™s say, on an Andromeda pit-stop, to mint ourselves into other universes.

Wait till Thiel funds Greyâ€™s Longevity Hub on Ethereum:
[Aubrey de Grey @aubreydegreyI now think there is a 50% chance that we will reach longevity escape velocity by 2036. After that point (the "Methuselarity"), those who regularly receive the latest rejuvenation therapies will never suffer from age-related ill-health at any age.](<TwitterEmbed id="1371196809595346950" /> PM âˆ™ Mar 14, 20211,531Likes369Retweets](<TwitterEmbed id="1371196809595346950" />
Currently, DAOs and LAOs are to DeFi what the so-called crypto-art is to NFTs. It is all a huge petri-dish. Like those tasty Bancor pools.

No, this is not a Pynchon book at all. That which we have been enjoying, and no-coiners have been observing is a Thiel lecture with airdrops.

Crypto (Twitter) is brimming with technical analyst who do not get it all about either money or the tech; and, those who cope already know that those who are in it for the tech have made much more Denarius than many self-acknowledging apes. The former are the real degens. They also happen to buidl.

I say petri-dish in that, in the last 6 months alone, the NFT-sphere has been able to lure in many minds. Even Saltz, who is after the conceptual bread after not having bought Ether below $300 is coping hard ðŸ¤¡:
[Jerry Saltz @jerrysaltzMost NFT so far is either Warhol Pop-y; Surrealism redux; animated cartoon-y; faux-Japanese Anime; boring Ab-Ex abstraction; logo swirling around commercial; cute/scary giff; glitzy screensaver; late Neo-conceptual NFT about NFT-ism. All Of those are NFT Zombie Formalism. D.O.A.](<TwitterEmbed id="1379056213460189184" /> PM âˆ™ Apr 5, 2021138Likes17Retweets](<TwitterEmbed id="1379056213460189184" />
He doesnâ€™t know what he is talking about is my only wish for him.

As once did the entire crypto-art sphere lynch dear Crypto Finally when she minted that she was in it for the money; any blockchain OG, as long as they are on Ehereum, have the right to diss the crowds whose resenttiment have a thicker skin in the game.
