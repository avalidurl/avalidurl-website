# /philosophy: A Permissionless Ideas and Decentralized Thought Network

The /philosophy Channel will have an automated curation by moderation process for the main feed thereof.

## Introducing the "Permissionless Idea and Decentralized Thought Network" for the /philosophy Channel

This post outlines the structure and subscription model for the /philosophy channel on Farcaster, designed to foster high-quality philosophical discourse through curated moderation.

### Key Points:

1. **Curation by Moderation**: The channel uses automated and manual curation to maintain signal-rich content in the main feed.

2. **Subscription Model**: A Hypersub subscription at 0.001 ether provides access to the curated main feed and group chat.

3. **Decentralized Approach**: The channel operates on principles of sufficient decentralization with economic guardrails.

4. **Community Building**: Focus on creating a mature platform for permissionless ideas and decentralized thought.

The channel aims to transform from a simple communication channel into a comprehensive platform for philosophical discourse and collective knowledge sharing.
