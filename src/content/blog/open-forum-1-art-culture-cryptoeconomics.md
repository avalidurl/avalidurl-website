People have been debating as to how “web3” and “metaverse” will be shaping art, culture, museology, galleries and the extended art market(s)—which means that retail, and self-acknowledging experts are already here, and some of these people are here to say. Good for societal modularity, in that, we will also need technologies and infrastructures that will be responding to the problematics towards which *permissionless blockchain *technologies cannot conceptualize for any other reason whatsoever.

I think that import titles with a focus on in-trad vocational habits, that are, art & culture industry “workers,” and institutions around and through them, whether established or unconventional, shaping metaverse and web3 more so that the latter do that to the former.

What do you think?
