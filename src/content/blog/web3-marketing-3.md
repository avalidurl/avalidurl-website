Tone down your language

# Tone down Your Language

**What?! **

'NOW, what I want is, Facts. Teach these boys and girls nothing
but Facts. Facts alone are wanted in life. Plant nothing else,
and root out everything else. You can only form the minds of
reasoning animals upon Facts: nothing else will ever be of any
service to them. This is the principle on which I bring up my own
children, and this is the principle on which I bring up these
children. Stick to Facts, sir!'

Reading this entry paragraph from Charles Dickens’ *Hard Times *will always remind me of another class on novelists during my undergraduate studies. However, anyone who would read it for the first or tenth time will possible be irritated upon the thought of having someone around preach in this tone. I would be.

**Preach!**

I am a power user, and am not willing to humbly shy away from using the pronoun I anytime soon since I have not the necessary comfort that Thoreau had, and which was way I created a .txt NFT that reads “the best DAO is that which governs the least”—which I ended up sending to an address that was buried as in a time capsule—if any CabinDAO people are reading, please help me find that address.

Do you know where you find the most obnoxious use of the pronoun I? In sentence structures that apparently help you run successful campaigns that convert airdrop farmers into full believers.

Many people in the web3 marketing quarters bite one another. As I have focused in the previous two pieces in these series on this blog, there is an in-demand race to belittle the average user in the first place in designing the user experience (UX).

**Be Humble**

We can reverse this and focus on the reality that there is a group of people, and their networked thought experiments which help our industry retain its resilience during the hard times such as the one we have been experiencing since Q1 2022—which will not end anytime soon, and believe me it does not matter whether you can profit in the most shallow part and times of liquidity.

We need to teach ourselves some facts:

**People who venture alongside you as power users do not like to be roasted at all times**—in your briefings, podcasts, videos, bulletins all the while you also get in a memes races with your rivals to milk more out of these people you imply to be detesting.

**Admit that you are not able to catch up with the exponentially emergent nature of the transfromating crypto-economics experience, and think twice**—before spurting out ledes that are misinformed, that FUD innovation, that support only your investors’ or founders’ views.

**Stop playing ID politics on others’ memes whereas all you do is just the same.**

**Stop doing propaganda and try to be insightful.**

**Do not bite people. This is not a thematic BDSM party.**
