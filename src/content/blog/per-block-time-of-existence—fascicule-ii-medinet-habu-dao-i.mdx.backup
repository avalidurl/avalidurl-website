I was about to ask for a Geist when I realized that I was the Geist.

I was the Geist.

I was the Geist.

I was the Geist.

I was the Geist.

I was the Geist.

[Fascicule I](https://mirror.xyz/gokhan.eth/ZFCOTBbSYz95VfzZ0kixpyiHfWZ5FBXSERZ-yJrY-eA)

It was a rainy December night where the [vantablack suns of existence](https://foundation.app/collection/vse) never set, and people and other non-human critters kept GM’ing one another on an endless ball of incentive alignment that propagated an optimism so down-to-earth, it bootstrapped networks that conveyed constellation-like ripples which helped the composable aura of ours form mood bridges that can be faucets from which those in need of dire happiness can mint themselves.

No, it is not a literary abstraction. We were literally able to mint ourselves from the vested pools of a sub-DAO called DECADES given that we can verify our collective membership to the Medinet Habu DAO.

mhDAO did not accept individual applications, and was running on a permissioned sandbox on an EVM compatible zkRollup as beaconed on a terraformed exoplanet with a backup on the first layer vessel ‘Oumuamua.

DECADES DAO was conceived once an accidental signal escaped unto the earworm data center of Distributed and United DAOs of Sound as run by an independent Agent that is but an Artificial Super Intelligence from the vantage point of your existence in your hypercube analogue of a 3D box within a slice of an enneract.
