Disclaimer

This post is by no means an investment advice.

 I value financial primitive, & social layer, experiment re-combinations since I strongly believe in the common sense of smart collectives, that is, I am in it for the tech.

The combination of composable social graph and financially technological block-building has culturally evolutionary implications for the society—hence, I am just sharing my personal notes here.

If you do not like to read whatsoever, please just skip to the Upcoming & Recently Launched Tokens on Farcaster Social Layer section which is behind a paywall via my Hypersub space (0.005 ether per month)—you can subscribe through [this link]().
