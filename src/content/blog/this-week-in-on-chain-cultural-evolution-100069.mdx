## JPG

JPG is a team of individuals who build a set of much-needed infrastructure for the curation of cultural objects on the plane of blockchain technologies. It is a portal to artistic exhibitions that beta curators thereof is now able to curate. They have recently launched an on-chain provenance feature in partnership with the permaweb pioneers Arweave.

*Cultural objects capture moments and paradigms, communities and heritage, and they ought to be preserved in order to be discovered for generations to come.*

where genuine artistic experiments meet conceptual shite-posting with style. They also have a Mirror log where they keep interviewing [nobodies](https://jpg.mirror.xyz/eAZi6PglxjMALBw2Mk4cnJxdxPGv6Bpcr5irWZp91Wc) such as myself.

I am a power-user of the platform where you already can curate exhibits than can be sold right on spot as in the traditional gallery setting where frogs wearing tuxedos buy your art on spot.

Wen I ❤️ JPG t-shirts?

## Mirror

Some of you might think that I am going to shill that synthetics protocol—no, I have never used it. However, I believe that almost all of you know how to look into this Mirror even though it lacks an automated RSS feed, and a search function for the writing NFTs that it hosts alongside other un-minted bloghouse of writing.

Mirror is essentially a tool-kit by means of which you might do anything funding and grant related on-chain. It is a multi-tool that any prepper might need in times of bear markets.

However, people such as myself are utilizing mirror as a springboard where they experiment with writing. I keep posting on Mirror other than Substack usually. I am writing on the evolution of sound NFTs (music NFTs) under the title PLAYLIST, or I just produce conceptual writing such as [this one](https://mirror.xyz/gokhan.eth/MO3N09UEu1IJaHDX-08wDCXRIkStdsVAO7espNGQt9Y).

They are active on both the Ethereum mainnet and one of its layer 2 solutions Optimistic Ethereum (Optimism) on the latter of which it is free to mint your writing NFTs.

**[Introducing Writing NFTs](https://dev.mirror.xyz/5gt60vKFJZ_tR1BjoJ7-Y0sNw7REebStHjzFU5x73J0)**

*Before Ethereum was code, it was a piece of writing. A year prior to Ethereum's launch in 2015, Vitalik Buterin published a whitepaper that laid out his vision for the project.*

who also happens to have a DAO to herself. Plus, you possibly do not know that Herndon has a track titled DAO from the year 2015 anno domino.

Herndon and the Gang who includes Mat Dryhurst, Joshua Citarella, New Models, Herndon & Dryhurst' Interdependence in partnership with Duncan Wilson, Cullen Miller, and James from Zora are to be the knight errands that are the harbingers of *general adversarial media networks* by means of [Channel](https://www.channel.xyz/).

Currently, Genesis founder token holders can access the aggregated (curated) RSS feed for audio as in podcasts from Interdependence, New Models, and Citarella.

I guess you should be in the look-up for the upcoming implementations.

**[Channel - Decentralized Media Organization](http://www.channel.xyz)**

*A decentralized media organization building tools to help creators join forces, token-enable their communities and experience the benefits of Web 3.*

on-chain, that is, the writing NFTs.

I personally am one of the moderators of the project Discord server (self-appointed, just wanted to spare some time around a meaningful culture hub potential).

Although it is a personal project, it was inevitable that a community is to form around it—hence, here we are. I need to warn that if you are looking for a DAO of Alphas blended with Sigmas, this ain't it.

You should have a look at the links provided in the below quoted tweet, first:
