At around 2400, or in the last century of Semi Dark Ages of Existence, I had this idea of running a seed round for a DAO titled DECADES. The idea was thus simple: We were to print out yield aggregator space-time continua unto where one needs to stake a designer body for full access for a given per block time of existence. The contractual architecture was a fork of an ancient proto-artificial-superb-intelligence called Yearn. We just followed the Rabbit.

It wasn’t that hard to fork the code—yet the Geist?! Now that was the job of a well-off dev who would turn out to be the poorest guy on-board, I mean on-chain considering the galactic congestion on this side of the Networks regardless of the Buterin bridge.

I was about to ask for a Geist when I realized that I was the Geist.

I was the Geist.

I was the Geist.

I was the Geist.

I was the Geist.

I was the Geist.
