If you have ever cared to read Koolhaas' [Delirious New York: A Retroactive Manifesto for Manhattan](), you'll easily discern that writing about music is as futile as making [sense]() about it. The book is not about music whatsoeverâ€”rather, it's about lorecraft, to which the entire supercluster of cryptographically secured ecosystems a la emergent idea markets can relate.

Hence, it's always of a well-versed mental gymnastics to write about music. I have decided to continue writing my smol pieces on music. Here is your daily allocation of sound with my over-reaching commentary.

Re: DDS. The most mechanical drum'n bass Butlerian junglist take ever by Demdike IMHO. Compared to their earlier casette attempts at the swampy melodicisms when it comes to mixes, this one sounds as if being governed by a Mark Fell clone.
