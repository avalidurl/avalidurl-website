AAVE 👻 [votes](https://app.aave.com/governance/5-QmYFSYTNqafvDsU1fUvCeAqJk1AuePJ2qvpE3XanJo6ZH6) to add xSUSHI 🍣, SushiSwap’s yield-bearing asset, to AAVE V2 market. Main motivations behind the proposal are **1)** to be the first platform to support xSUSHI, **2)** enable “Aavengers” to borrow against their xSUSHI, ie they can borrow against a yield bearing asset, **3)** support projects by the community. (Check pplpleasr’s wondrous meme thereabouts [here](https://twitter.com/pplpleasr1/status/1359677605780226049).)
