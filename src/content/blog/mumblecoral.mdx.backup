## I.

There is a chance that some of us will be outbidding to slay the moloch of aging, which is not a feature but a bug. For a species who are capable of leaving their home planet, which might or not be the Spaceship Earth, aging is a bug that be alleviated at first, and technologically abolished gradually.

## II.

## III.
