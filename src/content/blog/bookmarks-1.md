Stablecoins make great salamis and we won't need any breads around closed-loop payment operations, cross-border money transfers, card network payments in a couple of years. If you are nerd-sniped by Stripe's Bridge and Privy acquisitions and trying to make sense of the Coinbase, Shopify and USD Circle move, here is a nice research post on Bedlam Research: [https://www.bedlamresear.ch/posts/sandwich/](https://www.bedlamresear.ch/posts/sandwich/)

The latest Zvi Moskovitz post has rather nice reads into the system-of-systems lines navigating financial markets, AI as long as you read the entire post:

Speaking of Zvi, there is another post of his from 2023 on the AI and interest rates, and I like to read it in parallel with the latest developments around the foundational models, the state-of-not-so-great crypto-economics related artificial intelligence tooling—anyways, other than some propriety AI API ends like that of Messari, or some MCPs that are almost slop except for a few trading rails like that of CCXT, I really don't see any promising LLM-oriented products. It's utterly funny that people who hop among "decentralized university" network state airbnbs are yet to progressively innovate upon the currently proliferating cash flow liquidity attempts via "meaningful" real world assets (RWAs), LLMs—all we have are merde token launchers, and some chatbot interfaces that pass as "intents-centric" this and that. Literally, we can do better. Just deep dive into Kaggle and get inspired by some of the hackathons there instead of wasting resources: [https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2023/01/17/on-ai-and-interest-rates/](https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2023/01/17/on-ai-and-interest-rates/)

This Bloomberg feature on the Edgar hack is a nice Sunday read in my opinion. It could well be turned into a Law & Order episode if we had had good calibre entertainment trying to catch up with the perfection of Bear in 2025—via The Diff—I'm sharing it as a gift article, no paywalls: [How Hack of SEC's Edgar System Exposed Flaws in US Financial Security](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-06-06/how-hack-of-sec-s-edgar-system-exposed-flaws-in-us-financial-security?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0OTk4Njc3NiwiZXhwIjoxNzUwNTkxNTc2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWEZJR0xUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiI3QjI3NTVERDdCQzU0QkQ5QkE3QjM2RUIwMUEzNENFRSJ9.

A few friends were asking about the Israel-Iran context. I find the Sentinel Teams collective output, and Peter Wildeford's latest Substack post informing enough. [https://x.com/SentinelTeamHQ/status/1933379330362523842](https://x.com/SentinelTeamHQ/status/1933379330362523842) and
