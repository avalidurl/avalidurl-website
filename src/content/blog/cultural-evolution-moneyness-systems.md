I have a sizable prediction markets list. The way I see people are just biting one another. The smart amongst you would just better a system like *[Metaforecast](https://x.com/metaforecast?utm_source=gokhan.beehiiv.com)* within the crypto-economics enabled real money or play money markets—like those meta-aggregators across bridges, DEXs, AMMs—and capitalize thereabouts. That way you can also stress test if these protocols/ platforms are open source and decentralized just like they claim to be. People are really trying to bury one another because the Polymarket intern and Vitalik had a funny beef in public.

If you have ever visited a rather large, or contrarily a boutique, blockchain developers circles of some politickling clusters, you won't have lose time to label the irrational heads. By the time you make sure these people don't understand how systems and masses operate, don't worry, you are already labeled as the suit—suit being the fact that you shower daily. Making a counter-argument against their hallucinations? You'll be tagged. This is what I am thinking about whilst reading on *[Hasu's short post](https://x.com/hasufl/status/1912439030030999586?utm_source=gokhan.beehiiv.com)* on X re: stablecoins "crowding out" ETH, MEV/ REV, and the creation of a medium of exchange. In the meantime, I invite you to think about why we don't see some genuine architects of our current cryptographically secured economic systems such as *[Nick Szabo](https://x.com/NickSzabo4?utm_source=gokhan.beehiiv.com)*, or why civilizational level inventors like *[Wei Dai](https://x.com/weidai11?utm_source=gokhan.beehiiv.com)*—the cryptographer one—do not "ape into" the crowd politics when it comes to cultural evolution as accelerated by the SOTA distributed ledger technologies, electronic moneyness experiments, LLMs and all that jazz.

Now, this is not an ad hominem attack that is sneaky and implicit on anyone but I do not need pose like an apologist, either. Yes, there are many great minds across the EVM clusters yet they are mostly vendor-locked into benevolent dictates of finite gardens.

In the long term, any system-of-systems will try to recentralize unless the steering thereof won't require an oscillation between sufficient decentralization and optimal centralization. Ethereum is trying to replace the American Dynamism, and as Hasu points out to attain such levels of becoming-of a medium, a civilizational operating system takes time and reason. Otherwise, Bucky Fuller had also invented Dymaxion.
