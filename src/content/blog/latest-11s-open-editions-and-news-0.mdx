I’ve been writing a couple of long-form pieces that are featured to be in the Writing and NFTs and Playlist sections of my blogosphere, respectively this *Substack* and *[Mirror](https://gokhan.mirror.xyz)* and *[Paragraph](https://paragraph.xyz/@gokhan)*[](https://paragraph.xyz/@gokhan)and the good old *[Cent](https://beta.cent.co/goekhanturhan/)*, and whilst hanging out in the [JPG Discord](https://discord.gg/curatejpg) server, I just wanted to share what I have been creating lately. I am directly copy-pasting what I wrote in the JPG Discord server art share channel.
